## Analysis

#### Words
- **rich** — James has indicted the rich (across the chiasm) in 2/6.
- **weep** — James has used this verb in 4/9 already.
- **howl** — Unique in the NT here, this word is common enough in the LXX prophets (e.g. in Isaiah: [[Isaiah/13/6]], [[Isaiah/14/31]], {{LV|Isaiah|15|2|3}}, [[Isaiah/16/7]], [[Isaiah/23/1]],[[Isaiah/23/6|6]]).
- **miseries** — Found only here and Romans/3/16 in the GNT, but common enough in the LXX prophets and Psalms.

#### Phrases
- **come now y'all** — This phrase is an echo of 4/13, showing that they are both prophecies to people not present.
