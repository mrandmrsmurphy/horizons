## Analysis

#### Words
- **brethren** — The masculine plural of 'brother' covers people of both sexes.
- **partiality** — While this word occurs only once in James, it is parallels in this section with the essentially-the-same verb in [[James/2/9|verse 9]].
- **not ... partiality** — Paul has described God as not partial in [[Romans/2/11]], [[Ephesians/6/9]], and [[Colossians/3/25]].
- **glorious** — This is a noun in Greek, but it appears to be a very semitic (i.e. Hebrew) way of using it.  We have chosen to convey the sense from "of glory" by an adjectival phrase.

#### Phrases
- **Christ Jesus** — As in [[James/1/1]], he is referred to here by his title first, and his name second.  This is akin to saying "King Jesus".
- **the faith of ... Jesus** — As always, there is a twofold possibility to this phrase.  Does it refer to our faith in Jesus, or does it refer to his own faithfulness?  Keeping both in view, naturally, is only subtly different from the traditional interpretation.  How can we be prejudiced when Christ died for all?
