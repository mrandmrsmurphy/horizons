## Analysis

#### Words
- **meeting** — This is literally the work 'synaogue', reflecting <i>James'</i> early composition, when Christians still called their meeting/meeting places synagogue.
- **gold ring** — all one word in Greek, a hapax legomena.  Perhaps this might have reminded the original audience of the evil Haman, from [[Esther/3/10]] and the later vindication of Mordecai in [[Esther/8/2]].

#### Phrases
- **fine clothing** — Mockingly put on Jesus in [[Luke/23/11]], it is either Jesus or an angel wearing the same in Cornelius's vision in [[Acts/10/30]].  While not the exact same words, the idea is there in Esau's clothing from [[Genesis/27/15]].  A similar set of words is in [[Matthew/11/8]]
