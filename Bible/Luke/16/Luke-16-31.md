## Analysis

#### Words
- **listen to** — Perhaps the old translation is better: heed.

#### Phrases
- **he said to him** — That is, Abraham said to the Rich Man.
- **Moses and the Prophets** — That is, the Bible.
- **someone rises from the dead** — As we read about in [[John/11]], this really happened to a man named Lazarus, and the rich High Priest (Caiaphus) did not believe but was all the more hardened.
