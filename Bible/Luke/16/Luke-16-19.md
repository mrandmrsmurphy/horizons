## Analysis

#### Words
- **purple** — This is almost the only time this word is used in the GNT, but it is all over the end of Exodus.  There, it describes the tabernacle and the robes of the high priest.  Could it be doing the same here?  Is the rich man Caiaphus?
- **fine linen** — This is a hapax, a unique word in the GNT.  However, it is extremely common in the Book of Exodus, describing the tabernacle, it's furnishings and the robes of the High Priest.
