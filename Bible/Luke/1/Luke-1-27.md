## Analysis

#### Words
- **virgin** — This is the only place in the gospel where Luke uses this word, and he uses it twice!  Why?  It is not to condemn the sexual act, either as the source of sinful nature or as a lesser state of affair (compared to celibacy).  Instead, it is because Jesus will be the start of a New Humanity, another Adam.  Mary is not a perpetual virgin.  The emphasis is on her un-touched-ness, not sex per se.
- **Joseph** — Primarily, the name evoke the progenitor of the tribe, one of the sons of Israel, and the focus of the last dozen chapters of Genesis.  This connections was played up in Matthew.

#### Phrases
- **virgin betrothed** — These words occur together in [[Deuteronomy/22/23]].  As Calvin notes, there was a tradition of keeping the young girl at home for time after engagement.  Otherwise, why the law?
- **of the house of David** — LXX is the same as the Greek here in [[1 Samuel/20/16]]
