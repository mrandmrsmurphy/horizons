## Analysis

#### Words
- **known** â€” The Greek is present tense here: I do not know a man.  In English, we use the perfect (past tense) to say a completed action with ramifications into the present, but here it is ongoing.

#### Phrases

#### Concepts

Similar but different from Zechariah's question in [[Luke/1/18]].  Mary's question is literally, "How will this be?" a question of methods towards a believed path.  Zechariah's question seemed to come from more disbelief (as the angel said), something like "By what standard should I accept this?"
