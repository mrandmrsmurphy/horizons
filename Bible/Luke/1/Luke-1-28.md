## Analysis

#### Words
- **rejoice** — This is the normal Greek word for a greeting, but perhaps Luke is purposefully alluding to [[Zechariah/9/9]].
- **blessed/favored** — [[Ephesians/1/6]] says this blessing is ours now, heightening the metaphor that Mary is the embodiment of the Church, without being overly privileged as an individual.

#### Phrases
- **the LORD is with you** — very reminiscent of the call of Gideon in [[Judges/6/12]]
- **blessed among women** — all the women of the OT wished they could be Mary.  Jael drive the tent-peg into the skull of a kind of Satan herself ([[Judges/5/24]]), but Mary is the Eve to the promised fulfillment of the line.  She will give birth to the one who will crush Satan under his feet.  "With extraordinary ignorance have the Papist ... changed this salutation into a prayer.  ... Their ''Hail Mary'' ... [is] a simple congratulation. ... Their silly ambition leads them to a second blunder, for they salute a person who is absent." (Calvin)
