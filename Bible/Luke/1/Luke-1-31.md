## Analysis

#### Words
- **conceive** — Just as her cousin Elizabeth had done in [[Luke/1/24]].  The second of three usages of this word in Luke 1.  See also [[Luke/1/36]]
- **Jesus** — It would have been obvious to Hebrew and Aramaic speakers, but his name is transparently "Yahweh Saves".  See [[Matthew/1/21]]

#### Phrases
- **conceive in your womb** — This is concluded in [[Luke/2/21]]
- **conceive ... bear ... name** — This extremely close to verbatim from [[Isaiah/7/14]].  Even the word 'virgin' is there.
