## Analysis

#### Words
- **greeting** — the same rare word was used back in [[Luke/1/29]].  The verbal form appeared in the last verse to mark the start of this action.
- **baby** — Really, a fetus.  Salvation can occur within the womb! [[Luke/1/44]] has it too.  The English sense of "baby" (born) occurs in the next chapter: [[Luke/2/12]], [[Luke/2/16]].
- **leap** — Jesus himself encourages us to leap in [[Luke/6/23]].  It is used in the LXX of [[Psalm/114]], among other places.  The Greek is not the same, but the idea is present in [[2 Samuel/6/16]]

#### Phrases
- **in the womb** — A surprisingly common phrase in the GNT and LXX.  A lot goes on in there, even redemption!
- **filled with the Holy Spirit** — This was promised of Elizabeth's son in [[Luke/1/15]].  He spreads to John's dad in [[Luke/1/67]]
