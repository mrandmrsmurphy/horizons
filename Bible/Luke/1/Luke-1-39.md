## Analysis

#### Words
- **haste** — the only time Luke ever uses this word.  The verb appears in [[Luke/2/16]], where it also describes swift the obedience of belief.  The verb is also in [[Luke/19/5]], [[Luke/19/6]], [[Acts/20/16]], [[Acts/22/18]]
- **went** — This was probably a 50~70 mile journey!
- **hill country** — This is where Joshua fought to so hard to secure the Land.
- **city** — "This was most probably Hebron, a city of the priests, and situated in the hill country of Judea, (Jos 11:21; 21:11, 13,) about 25 miles south of Jerusalem, and nearly 100 from Nazareth. Such was the intense desire of Mary's mind to visit and communicate with her relative Elisabeth, that she scrupled not to undertake this long journey to effect her purpose."

#### Phrases
- **arose and went** — This is the first of many parallels with [[2 Samuel/6]], specifically the same Greek verbs are used in the LXX of [[2 Samuel/6/2]].
- **hill country of Judea** — comes back in [[Luke/1/65]]
