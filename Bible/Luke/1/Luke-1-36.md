## Analysis

#### Words
- **conceive** — The third of three usages of this word in Luke 1.  See also [[Luke/1/31]] and [[Luke/1/24]]
- **relative** — again in [[Luke/1/58]]
- **old age** — a hapax in the GNT, but used of this exact state – having a child when old – in [[Genesis/21/7]]
- **six** — It is rare to mention numbers, so perhaps this verse (along with v.26) correspond with [[Luke/23/44]]...

#### Phrases
- **called barren** — Luke himself called her that in [[Luke/1/7]]!
