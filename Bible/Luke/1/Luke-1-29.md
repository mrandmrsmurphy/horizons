## Analysis

#### Words
- **greatly troubled** — Zachariah was troubled back in [[Luke/1/12]].
- **salutation** — Elizabeth will repeat this word [[Luke/1/41]] and [[Luke/1/44]].  It is used negatively in each Synoptic Gospel by Jesus condemning the Pharisees for wanting them ([[Matthew/23/7]], [[Mark/12/38]], and [[Luke/11/43]]); and three times by Paul as he signed his letters ([[1 Corinthians/16/21]], [[Colossians/4/18]], [[2 Thessalonians/3/17]]).

#### Phrases
- **at his word** — Calvin notes how strange it is that she is troubled so little by the ''appearance'' of the angel that Luke doesn't mention it, but so much by his word that he does.  Truly humble, Mary was shocked that she deserved such exultation.  How sad she must be now to hear so many Papists repeating their twaddle to her!
