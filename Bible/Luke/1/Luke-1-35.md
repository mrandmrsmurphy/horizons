## Analysis

#### Words
- **most high** — already used as a name for God in [[Luke/1/32]]
- **Spirit** — already mentioned in [[Luke/1/15]].  The Holy Spirit is a big player in the chapter!
- **overshadow** — This word appears in all three synoptic gospels at the Mount of Transfiguration ([[Matthew/17/5]], [[Mark/9/7]], [[Luke/9/34]]).  These parallel its use in [[Exodus/40/35]] of the cloud overshadowing the Tabernacle.  Luke will use this word again of Peter's shadow healing people in [[Acts/5/15]].
- **holy (one)** — "The manner of conception, therefore, assures us that we have a Mediator ''separate from sinners'' ([[Hebrews/7/26]])." - Calvin

#### Phrases
- **Holy Spirit come-upon** — The exact same words are used of the Pentecost experience, in [[Acts/1/18]], of all the disciples/apostles.  Mary is an amazing precursor to the Church.
- **son of God** — Surprisingly (to our ears), this term is actually indicative of ''person'', a royal title all ANE language use to describe their kings.
