## Analysis

#### Words
- **afraid/fear** — A surprising theme in Luke 1, fear has already happened in [[Luke/1/12]], [[Luke/1/13]]
- **you** — The verb is not conjugated in the second-person plural but rather the singular.  Israel is not doing well and God's forgiveness is not coming upon them ''en masse'' but to individuals, starting with Mary.

#### Phrases
- **fear not** — Angels are always having to say this!  They must be really scary.  [[Daniel/10/12]], [[Daniel/10/19]], [[Luke/1/13]], [[Genesis/21/17]], [[Luke/2/10]], [[Matthew/28/5]], [[Acts/27/24]], etc.
