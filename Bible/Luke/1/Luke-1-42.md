## Analysis

#### Words
- **and** — Calvin suggests 'because', which is partly applicable, but an over-translation.
- **blessed** — "To carry Christ in her womb was not Mary's first blessedness, but was greatly inferior to the distinction of being born again by the Spirit of God to a new life.  Yet she is justly called blessed, on whom God bestowed the remarkable honor of bringing into the world his own Son, through whom she had been spiritually renewed.  And at this day, the blessedness brought to us by Christ cannot be the subject of our praise, without reminding us, at the same time, of the distinguished honor which God was pleased to bestow on Mary, on maker her the mother of his only begotten Son." (Calvin)
- **called out** — the only time this word appears in the GNT.
- **fruit** — Every other time Luke uses the word 'fruit', he's talk about the consequences of action, "the fruit of belief".

#### Phrases
- **called out with a loud voice** — Jesus himself will do so in [[Luke/23/46]]
- **Blessed are you among women** — verbatim what the angel said in [[Luke/1/28]].  Again, sounds very much like [[Judges/5/24]].
