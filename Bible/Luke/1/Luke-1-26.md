## Analysis

#### Words
- **city** — we would say, hardly a village!
- **city of Galilee** — Luke has to explain to his audience where Nazareth is because nobody knows!
- **Gabriel** — The last (and only other) time we saw this angel, was [[Daniel/8]] and [[Daniel/9]] (besides verse 19).
- **[[Nazareth]]** — Even though John the Baptist will be a Nazarite, Luke cannot make any of the fun puns Matthew Levi does in his prologue, because his gentile readers don't speak Hebrew!

#### Phrases
- **in the sixth month** — that is, the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy (cp [[Luke/1/24|v.24]]).  As Calvin notes, the event of Zechariah meeting an angel in the Temple could not have helped but become very know, all over Israel.  Contrast that angelic announcement with this one, known only to a teenager girl in the sticks!
