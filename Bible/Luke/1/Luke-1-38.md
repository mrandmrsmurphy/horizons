## Analysis

#### Words
- **word** — used in the last verse, and similar verbage to [[Psalm/119/38]]
- **depart** — Just as this section is ending with this word, so too did the last section end in [[Luke/1/25]] with it.

#### Phrases
- **handmaiden of the LORD** — Very reminiscent of {{LV|2 Samuel|7|25|29}} and [[Psalm/116/16]]
