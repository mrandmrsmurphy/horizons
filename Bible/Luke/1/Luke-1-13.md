## Analysis

#### Words
- **John** — The last time this name had been named is [[1 Chronicles/6/10]] "(he it is that executed the priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem:)", a fitting name for a son of a priest!  The long form [[Help:Hebrew:יהוחנן|Yehohanan]] only appears in genealogies.
