## Analysis

#### Words
- **Lord** — Does Elizabeth mean YHWH?  Probably.  Or at least, she is quoting [[Psalm/101/1]], where David calls him Lord, the anointed/appointed of Yahweh, the Messiah.  He "has received from the Father all power, and has been appointed the highest ruler of heaven and earth, that by his agency God may govern all things."  (Calvin)  Jesus is called LORD definitively in [[Luke/1/75]] and possibly in [[Luke/2/11]].

#### Phrases
- **question** — Most of this question is very reminiscent of [[2 Samuel/6/9]]b, where David asks a similar inquiry.
