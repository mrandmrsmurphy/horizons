- **reign ... kingdom** — From the same root in Greek.  Informally, would could say "He will king it up ... and his kingdom will never end"
- **House of Jacob** — "the church, which is scattered through the whole world, is the spiritual house of Jacob; for it drew it origin from Zion" (Calvin)
- **kingdom ... forever** — Reminiscent of [[Daniel/7/14]], a reminder that God is fulfilling all the promised future-history He foretold in that book.
