## Analysis

#### Words
- **happy** â€” A different word than "blessed" from the previous verses.  This is "what the true happiness of men consists.  Mary was blessed because embracing from the heart the promise of God, she conceived and brought forth a savior to herself and the whole world.  This was peculiar to her." (Calvin)
