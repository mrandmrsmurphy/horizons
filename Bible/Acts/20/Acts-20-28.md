## Analysis

#### Words
- **take heed** — This is the sixth and final time this word is used in Acts.
- **flock** — this rare-ish word occurs here and the next verse alone in Acts.  This might be a diminutive form, compared to the word used in [[Luke/2/8]].
- **overseer** — or 'bishop'.  Used interchangeably with 'elder' in the NT.
- **shepherd** — Impossible to convey in English, this word is etymologically related to 'flock'.
- **Lord** — some manuscripts have 'God'
- **purchased** — Remarkably, in another passage about church leaders -- [[1 Timothy/3/13]] -- this verb is used of human agents who are not God!
