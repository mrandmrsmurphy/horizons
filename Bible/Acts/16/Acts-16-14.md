## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **God worshiping woman** â€” an idiosyncratic phrase: not full proselytes, that is, not yet converts to Judaism, attached themselves to the Jewish religion, practiced its monotheistic and imageless worship, and observed the Sabbath and some other ritual laws. [F.F. Bruce, The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text, 215]
