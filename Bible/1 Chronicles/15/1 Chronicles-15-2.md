## Analysis

#### Words
- **for** — opens a purpose clause, i.e. how can David be so insistent about the exclusivity of Levitical worship?

#### Phrases
- **carry the ark of God, and to minister to him** — a clear reference to [[Deuteronomy/10/8]]
- **chose ... forever** — seems to hint at [[Deuteronomy/18/5]]
