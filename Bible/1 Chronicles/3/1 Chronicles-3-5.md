## Analysis

#### Words
- **Bathshua** — Seemingly, a bizarre (mis-)spelling of [[Bathsheba]].  "In the royal mother’s name, the patronymic forms Eliam/Ammiel are interchangable (cf. Jeconiahu—Jehoiachin and more), while a close similarity also exists between ‘Bathsheba’ and ‘Bathshua’. These could reflect alternative spellings or an adaptation of the original ‘Bathsheba’ to the name of Judah’s first wife, following a general inclination to parallelism between David’s household and that of Judah; note that both Bathshua and Tamar are explicitly mentioned in Judah’s biography (1 Chron. 2:3–4)." - Sara Japhet, ''I & II Chronicles: A Commentary, First American edition.'', The Old Testament Library (Louisville, KY; London: Westminster John Knox Press, 1993), 96.
