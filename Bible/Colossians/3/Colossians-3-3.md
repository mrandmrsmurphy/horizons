## Analysis

#### Words
- **died** — When did we die?  Compare [[Romans/6/4]] or even in this letter in [[Colossians/2|chapter 2]].  Our big death was our baptism, not the end of this earthly life.
- **hidden** — this is the gospel revealed ([[Colossians/1/26|1:26]]), that we are made alive in Him who is our treasure ([[Colossians/2/3|2:3]]).  We don't want our old, dying life, but a new and better one in Him.
