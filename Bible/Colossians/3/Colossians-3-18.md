## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **(the) wives** — literalistically, “O the women”, but in this cultural circumstances, there would be very few unmarried, grown-up women.
- **(the) husband** — again, lit. “To the men”, but we are clearly talking about husbands.
- **be submitted** — This is a second-person plural, present imperative middle, a command in the passive voice and imperfective aspect.
