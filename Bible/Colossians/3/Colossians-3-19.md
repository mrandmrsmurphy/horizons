## Analysis

#### Words
- **love** — a imperfective-aspect command.  Here it must be commanded of most men to actively take action, not passively stay out of her way.
- **do not be embittered** — this is (functionally) a passive voice.  There are circumstances beyond a man’s control which might make him bitter.  Paul is commanding a response to things which cause bitterness, not those things themselves.

#### Phrases
- **(the) husbands** — again, as in the last verse, this is a good translation because Greek didn’t typically need to distinguish between men and husbands.
- **(the) wives** — again, lit. The women.
