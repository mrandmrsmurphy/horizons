## Analysis

#### Words
- **holy (ones)** — trad. saints, the Greek is just the adjective.  God makes us holy ([[Colossians/1/12|v.12]]), even as we are already holy in His sight ([[Colossians/1/22|v.22]]).  This governs our attitude towards others ([[Colossians/1/4|v.4]]) and our own, individual behavior ([[Colossians/3/12|3/12]]).  Only God's holy people take up this call ([[Colossians/1/26|v.26]]).  The saints are holy, meaning we can go into the holy of holies.
- **Colossae** — a small, less important town.
- **grace** — the reception of the gifts of God
- **peace** — being at peace with God (with whom we are by nature at enmity) bends outward and turns into peace with people.

#### Phrases
- **faithful brothers** — the [[Ephesians/1/1|Ephesians]] are faithful, but not brothers.  This especially warm appellative may be caused by the fact that Paul never met these brothers, but is issuing a stern caution.  Perhaps he wants to indicate that he does not doubt their faith, but only wants to warn off the false teachers.
- **<s>and the Lord Jesus Christ</s>** — The Majority Text adds this phrase to the end of the verse.  It is only absent here and [[1 Thessalonians/1/2]].
