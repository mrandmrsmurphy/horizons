## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **the hope** — What --- or who --- is '''''the''''' hope, which is stored up in heaven?  It/he is Jesus Christ, of course!
- **truth of the good-news** — The Gospel is contrasted with a mystery, something not yet revealed.  The Colossians need to know that everything has already been made plain, and there is nothing left to wait for, before laying hold of the promises of God.
