## Analysis

#### Words
- **thrones** — This is the only time Paul ever uses this word ([[Help:Greek:ΘΡΟΝΟΣ|θρόνος]]).  There rare cases when it is in the plural ([[Daniel/7/9]], [[Psalm/122/5]], [[Haggai/2/22]], [[Luke/1/52]]) outside of the Book of Revelation, it typically refers to evil kingdoms, i.e. those of demons and devils.
- **principalities** — Paul will use this word three times more in Colossians, once to mean 'beginning' ([[Colossians/1/18|v18]]) and twice with power, once in the singular ([[Colossians/2/10|2:10]]) and once in the plural ([[Colossians/2/15|2:15]]).

#### Phrases
- **all things** — the article ("''the'' all (things)") unites all creation in contradistinction to Christ.
- **thrones or dominions or principalities or powers** — this is almost the exact same list as in [[Ephesians/1/21]].  There [[Help:Greek:ΔΥΝΑΜΙΣ|δύναμις]]/power substitutes for θρόνος/thrones.

#### Concepts

## Thoughts
- **thrones or dominions or principalities or powers** — of all the created things Paul could've mentioned, he chooses these!
