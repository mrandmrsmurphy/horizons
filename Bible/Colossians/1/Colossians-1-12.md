## Analysis

#### Words
- **light** — The 'light' is another name for the Day ([[Genesis/1/5]]), the Day of the Lord, the Kingdom of God.

#### Phrases
- **made us fit** — the once and for all accomplishment of Jesus Christ on the cross makes believers inherit the Kingdom of the Father, with nothing more needed from us to qualify.  The Colossians must have been confused on this point.
