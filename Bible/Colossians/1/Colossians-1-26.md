## Analysis

#### Words
- **mystery** — this verse is one of the definitional sources for the specific way the NT uses this term ([[Help:Greek:ΜΥΣΤΗΡΙΟΝ|''musterion'']]).  It is not a mystery as in a "murder mystery movie".  It is the gospel, the secret hid from our unbelieving eyes unless the Lord reveals it to us.
- **hidden** — when we did not see Christ for who he is, we missed out on wisdom and knowledge ([[Colossians/2/3|2:3]]).  In face, we missed out on ''our own'' lives ([[Colossians/3/3|3:3]]).
- **holy (ones)** — trad. ''saints''.  The Greek just has the adjective (like ''The Good, The Bad and The Ugly'').  Believers are set apart.  Here, the emphasis is on how understanding the gospel/mystery is a result of being designed for a particular purpose by God.
