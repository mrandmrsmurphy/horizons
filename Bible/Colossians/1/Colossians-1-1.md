## Analysis

#### Words
- **apostle** — here, in the technical sense, of one given direct authority by Jesus Christ personally.  Paul is preempting any heresy's claim to truth.
- **Timothy** — Also in the "from" sections of [[2 Corinthians/1/1|2 Corinthians]], [[1 Thessalonians/1/1|1 Thessalonians]], [[Philippians/1/1|Philippians]] and [[Philemon/1/1|Philemon]].  He is here partly so that "every charge may be established on the word of two witnesses" ([[Deuteronomy/19/15]]).  Timothy doesn't seem to have been part of the authoring directly.

#### Phrases
- **apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God** — While a generally positive letter, Paul begins by boldly asserting his authority on the basis of the [[Will of God]] exactly as in [[2 Corinthians/1/1]], [[Ephesians/1/1]], [[2 Timothy/1/1]].  He does not mention his "calling" as in [[1 Corinthians/1/1]]).  None of his self-defenses are as strong as [[Galatians/1/1]].
