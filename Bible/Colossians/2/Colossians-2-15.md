## Analysis

#### Words
- **stripped** — Roman triumphal processions sometimes involved parading the defeated foes naked through town, in humiliation.
- **triumph** — because Christ thrashed his enemies so badly, we are also victorious over them ([[2 Corinthians/2/14]]
- **it** — that is, the Cross

#### Phrases
- **principalities and powers** — already mentioned in [[Colossians/1/16|1:16]] and (in the singular) [[Colossians/2/10|2:10]]
- **made an example of them** — just what Joseph did ''not'' want to do to Mary ([[Matthew/1/19]]) and just as Sodom and Gomorra ''do'' server as examples to us still ([[Jude/1/7]])
