## Analysis

#### Words
- **dwell** — Christ also dwells with us.  Why?  So we can be grounded in him ([[Ephesians/3/17]])
- **Godhead** — a unique word, others divinity or divine nature
- **bodily** — another unique word.  The adjectival form occurs in [[Luke/3/22]], [[1 Timothy/4/8]].  Equally good is "corporeally"

#### Phrases
- **for in him all the fullness dwell...** — these words are almost verbatim [[Colossians/1/19|1:19]]
