## Analysis

#### Words
- **conflict** — the verb form of this word has already occurred in [[Colossians/1/29|1:29]] and will come again in [[Colossians/4/12|4:12]]. There it speaks of personal work in sanctification and prayer.

#### Phrases
- **in <s>the</s> flesh** — the article does not occur in the original.  Why does Paul include the phrase?Likely, because they felt they did know or had "seen" Paul spiritually.
