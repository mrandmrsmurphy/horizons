## Analysis

#### Words
- **see** — Paul ''saw'' ([[Help:Greek:ΒΛΕΠΩ|βλεπω]]) their orderliness and steadfastness ([[Colossians/2/5|2:5]]), but now he commands them to be on their guard lest they be despoiled, like a crime victim
- **rob** — carry off as booty, lead captive ([[Help:Greek:ΣΥΛΑΓΩΓΕΩ|συλαγωγέω]])
- **philosophy** — Paul's use is not so different from ours today.  From the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] to the [[Socinianism|Socinians]], right up to our modern [[Process Theology|Process Theologians]], putting theology into philosophical categories has yielded disaster after disaster.
- **tradition** — Not good or bad in and of itself: Paul commends some in [[1 Corinthians/11/2]] and [[2 Thessalonians/2/15]]/[[2 Thessalonians/3/6|3:6]], but condemns others in [[Galatians/1/14]]

#### Phrases
- **rob through philosophy** — how can someone plunder through ideas? The hint is through the pun of rob/sulagogeo/συλαγωγέω which sounds like sunagoge/synagogue. Josephus uses philosophia to describe the different Jewish “sects” of the first century. [http://www.leithart.com/2010/08/16/spoilers/]
