## Analysis

#### Words
- **not made with hands** — here as elsewhere, it is clear the "non-handmade-things" means "made by God" and "of spiritual reality" ([[Mark/14/58]] and [[2 Corinthians/5/1]])
- **put-off** — just as circumcision is the cutting away of the foreskin, so spiritual circumcision is the taking off of something, that is, the Old Man
- **flesh** — the dying, physical reality as it currently stands.  As with all things, if it is not renewed, it will perish

#### Phrases
- **body of the flesh** — we would say, in theological parlance, the sinful nature.  It is in contrast to our New Body, which the eye has not seen.
- **circumcision of Christ** — not the cutting away of Jesus' foreskin ([[Luke/2/21]]) but the inward reality affected ''by'' Christ
