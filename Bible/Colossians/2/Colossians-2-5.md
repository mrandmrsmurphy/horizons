## Analysis

#### Words
- **order** — ''paraphrase:'' orderliness.  This is in contrast to the Corinthians church ([[1 Corinthians/14/40]]).  This could be an administrative term ([[Luke/1/8]]):  Christ himself followed after an order ([[Hebrews/5/6]], [[Hebrews/5/10|10]], [[Hebrews/6/20|6:20]], [[Hebrews/7/11|7:11]], [[Hebrews/7/17|17]] citing [[Psalm/110/4]]).  It could also be a military term.
- **steadfastness** — Throughout the LXX, it typically means firmament, but it can also mean "fortress".

#### Phrases
- **in the flesh** — [[Colossians/2/1|2:1]], [[Colossians/1/24|1:24]] We would say "bodily".
- **in the Spirit** — a very similar wording to [[Colossians/1/8|1:8]].  Just as they are with Paul, so he is with all who have the bond of the Holy Spirit in common.
- **for/into/toward/concerning Christ** — this rare phrase (a thousand times less common than "in Christ") also occurs in [[Acts/20/21]], [[Acts/24/24|24:24]]; [[Romans/6/3]], [[Romans/16/5|16:5]]; [[1 Corinthians/8/12]], [[2 Corinthians/1/21]]; [[2 Corinthians/11/3|11:3]]; [[Galatians/2/16]], [[Galatians/3/24|3:24]], [[Galatians/3/27|27]]; [[Ephesians/5/32]]; [[Philemon/1/6]]; [[1 Peter/1/11]].  A specific kind of faith is hereby specified, the kind pointing '''''to''''' Christ.

#### Concepts

## Reflections
- **Spiritual Reality** — As long as we regard the spiritual as some kind of mystical sub-set of physical reality, this will make no sense to us.  Instead, the material world is a subset of the spiritual.  Physical presence is nothing without Spiritual presence, as all those who saw Jesus in the flesh but it benefited them nothing might now testify.  "Reality" is what God says it is, and Paul is with us and was with the Colossians, just as he was with them.
