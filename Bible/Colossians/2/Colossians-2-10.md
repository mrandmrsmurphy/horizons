## Analysis

#### Words
- **full** — the Colossians were being tempted by false teachers who spoke of getting "full" Christianity by adding extra steps.  Paul is asserting that they are already full, in Christ.  See also [[Colossians/1/9|1:9]], [[Colossians/1/25|25]], [[Colossians/4/17|4:17]].
- **head** — Paul has already called Christ the head in [[Colossians/1/18|1:18]] and will again in [[Colossians/2/19|2:19]].  These verses also contain references to "body", like the [[Colossians/2/9|previous verse]]' "bodily".

#### Phrases
- **in him you are made full** — just as Christ has the fullness of God, we are filled up with him.
- **head ... principality** — resembles "head ... beginning" (in Greek) from [[Colossians/1/18|1:18]]
- **principality and power** — the pairing (in the plural) has already been mentioned in [[Colossians/1/16|1:16]]
