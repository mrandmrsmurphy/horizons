## Analysis

#### Words
- **Achippus** — Presumed to be the same one mentioned in [[Philemon/1/2]]
- **received** — all the Colossians had received Christ ([[Colossians/2/6|2:6]]).
- **fulfill** — Paul prays that they would all be ''filled'' ([[Colossians/1/9|1:9]]), though in an important sense, they are already 'full' ([[Colossians/2/10]]).  Archippus' call is no different than Paul's, or any other minister's ([[Colossians/1/25|1:25]]).
- **you** — this verse and [[Colossians/2/21|2:21]] contain the only 2nd-person singular verbs in the whole of the epistle.
