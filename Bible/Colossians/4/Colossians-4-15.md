## Analysis

#### Words
- **assembly** — or ''church''.  This is is the third of four uses in Colossians ([[Colossians/1/18|1/18]], [[Colossians/1/24|1/24]] and [[Colossians/4/16|4/16]]).

#### Phrases
- **in her house** — the Greek is not [[Help:Greek:ΕΝ|εν]]/''en'' 'in', but [[Help:Greek:ΚΑΤΑ|κατα]]/''kata'' 'from'.  The meaning is either ''distributive'': "indicating the division of a greater whole into individual parts" or ''reference'': "with respect to, with reference to".  Note [[Colossians/4/16|the next verse]], where the phrase is '''''of''''' Laodicea.
