- **mystery** — this is the fourth and last time Paul uses this special word in this epistle ([[Colossians/1/26|1:26]], [[Colossians/1/27|27]]; [[Colossians/2/2|2:2]]).  It does not mean an unsolvable riddle, rather, an incomprehensible-without-God reality, the gospel of Jesus Christ, salvation.

- **in the word** — in [[2 Corinthians/2/12]] it's "in the Lord"

## Reflections

Don't just pray about yourself, but pray for others!  Prayer should be practice in taking your eyes off yourself.

Paul asks for prayer, which is something we should emulate.  Unless we are open and in community, no one will have anything to pray!
