## Analysis

#### Words
- **Paul** — who began the letter ([[Colossians/1/1|1:1]]), signs it, as we do today.
- **remember!** — Paul reminded the [[Ephesians/2/11]] that the Gentiles have been brought near.  The Author to the Hebrews reminded his audience to bear their leaders in mind ([[Hebrews/13/7]]).  Jesus wants us  to remember Lot's wife ([[Luke/17/32]]). Moses exhorted the Jews the first Passover to rmember their salvation ([[Exodus/13/3]]). [[1 Chronicles/16/12]] [[John/15/20]]  Maybe it's remember to repent [[Revelation/2/5]]
