#### Phrases
- **white wool** — LXX has 'wool of Miletus'.  "In Virgil's 'Georgics', the text reads Milesia uellera, "Milesian wool", referring to the soft, fine wool for which Miletus in southwestern Anatolia was noted."  "The highest accolades for wool quality went to *Miletus, and true ‘fine-wool’ has been identified in extant fabrics from Nymphaeum (mod. Geroevka) in the Crimea" (OCD)
