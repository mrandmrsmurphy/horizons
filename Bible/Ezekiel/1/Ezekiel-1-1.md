## Analysis

#### Words
- **saw** — No prophet in the Old Testament was given so many visions as Ezekiel. No book of the Old Testament reports so many or has so much of its space devoted to visions. Other prophets had them – though it was by no means the only way God revealed himself and his will to his prophets – but no one, with the possible exception of John in Revelation saw so much. [Stuart, 27-28] Ezekiel, we are going to find – important for people like ourselves who live in a very visually oriented society – is a very visual book.

#### Phrases
- **thirtieth year** — it seems most likely to refer to [[Ezekiel the Prophet]]'s age at the time of his first vision and his calling. This would be the year in which he would have been inducted into his service as a priest, but, of course, he is now far from the temple. But God had not forgotten him.
- **** — He lived in a community of expatriate Jews on the [[Khabur River]], it appears – so we gather from [[Ezekiel/3/15|3:15]] – at [[Tel Abib]]. The Khabur River was, in fact, a great irrigation canal that took water from the [[Euphrates]] at the city of [[Nippur]] and carried it in a large semi-circle through the countryside until it rejoined the Euphrates near [[Uruk]].
- **visions of God** — this is the recurrent phrase from [[Ezekiel/8/3|8:3]] and [[Ezekiel/40/2|40:2]]. What follows is a vision – something that Ezekiel saw – but it is nevertheless the Word of the Lord, his communication to his people through his prophet.

#### Concepts
- **the thirtieth year, the fourth month, the fifth day** — July 31, 593 BC
