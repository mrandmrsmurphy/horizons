## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **in the land of the Chaldeans** — The fact that the divine glory of Yahweh was revealed to Ezekiel in Babylon – a point of emphasis in this verse – confirms the fact that Yahweh is no ancient Near Eastern deity whose influence was limited to the territory over which he was thought to have jurisdiction. [Block, i, 83-84]
- **the hand of the LORD was upon him** — means that the Lord had complete control of this man.  Ezekiel was an (initially) unwilling prophet.
