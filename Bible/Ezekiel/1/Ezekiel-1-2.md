## Analysis

#### Words
- **Jehoiachin** — Jehoiachin was a no-account. He reigned for three months and accomplished nothing. So, at first, it is surprising that Ezekiel should have dated his oracles by the deportation of Jehoiachin. But Jehoiachin was also regarded by the Jews as the last legitimate Davidic king. In him, Jeremiah's prophecy of the temporary end of the Davidic line came to fulfillment. Those that followed him on the throne in Jerusalem were Babylonian appointees and did not occupy the direct line back to David. Interestingly, this seems to have been acknowledged in Jerusalem as well. Three jar handles from the time of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah, his successor, all bearing the inscription "belonging to Eliakim, the servant of Jehoiachin," have been found in southern Palestine. Unless they were crafted during the three months of Jehoiachin’s reign, his authority as the true king seems to have been acknowledged even after his exile. Babylonian inscriptions suggest the same thing as they refer to him as "the king of the land of Judah" even in Babylon and after other men occupied the throne by Babylonian appointment. So Ezekiel will date his prophecies from the exile of Jehoiachin.
