## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **Now he [YHWH] called to Moses** — Moses did not prepare his heart to receive the Word of Yahweh. He did not get himself into the mood to hear some inner voice. Moses may not have been expecting Yahweh to call to him at all. Yahweh initiates the speech and its contents, which concern approaching Him. We do not come to worship when and how we wish, but we come because God calls us and tells us when and how. God initiates worship. - James Jordan
- **out of the Tent of Appointment** — God calls from the “tent of meeting” and not “from Sinai” because He is calling the people to meet with Him. Compare {{LV/2|Leviticus|7|37|38}}, which says that the revelation came from Mount Sinai, terming it Instructions (torah). Generally speaking, laws come from Sinai; invitations from the tent of meeting. - J.J.
