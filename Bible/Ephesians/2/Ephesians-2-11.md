## Analysis

After the exhortation, this verse is a -part  a. once - b. in the flesh - c. uncircumcision - c' circumcision - b' in the flesh - a' handmade

#### Words
- **remember** — "The exhortation to remember, which stand like a rubric over vv. 11, 12, does not mean that they have actually forgotten what they were, only that Paul wants to tell them to call these matter to their attention so that they will have a greater understanding and appreciation of the past and they might reversal Christ has affected on their behalf."<ref>O'Brien, ''Ephesians'', 185</ref>
- **you** — having assimilated his hearers into "we", Paul once again calls them "you" in order to emphasis where they have come from and the salvation which has forever altered them. "The pronoun is in the first part of the sentence for emphasis"<ref>Hoehner, ''Ephesians'', 353</ref>
- **the Nations** — trad. Gentiles.  This is the first of five explicit mentions of the Gentiles in Ephesians.
- **Foreskin** — trad. 'uncircumcision'.  it is anarthrous, so could even be translated "''a'' foreskin".  The derogatory nature of what the Jews called others is emphasized.

#### Phrases
- **Gentiles in the flesh** — Gentiles/Nations automatically means those outside of the Covenant community.  But that isn't what Paul is talking about.  He qualifies his word with "in flesh", meaning those outside of the Nation of Israel, people without the ritual of circumcision in their tradition.
- **Circumcision ... in the flesh** — Paul has to specify what kind of "people of the circumcision" he is talking about because we are all "the circumcision" now.  That is, all Christians are circumcised in the Spirit ([[Ephesians/2/22|v22]]).
