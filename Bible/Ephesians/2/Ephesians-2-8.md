## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **that** â€” What does "that" refer back to?  Is it 'grace' or 'faith'?  Neither ... and both.  The word is neuter, but both grace and faith are feminine.  Therefore, 'that' refers to them both together, as part of the phrase.[http://www.koinoniablog.net/2011/10/antecedents-and-faith-eph-28-9-monday-with-mounce-113.html]
