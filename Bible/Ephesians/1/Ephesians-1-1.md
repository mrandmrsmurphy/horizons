## Analysis

#### Words
- **Paul** — No longer his birth name (Saul of Tarsus) but the Great Missionary to the Gentiles.  Paul will say his own name again in [[Ephesians/3/1|3/1]].
- **Apostle** — a commissioned ambassador who speaks for another with full authority.  See [[Ephesians/2/20|2/20]], [[Ephesians/3/5|3/5]] & [[Ephesians/4/11|4/11]].
- **will** — used some in Pauline Greetings, but also very large in Ephesians.  25% (6/24) of Paul's uses of this word occur in this book ([[Ephesians/1/5|v5]], [[Ephesians/1/9|9]], [[Ephesians/1/11|11]], [[Ephesians/2/3|2/3]], [[Ephesians/5/17|5/17]] and [[Ephesians/6/6|6/6]]).

#### Phrases

#### Concepts
- **[[Pauline Epistles#Openings]]** — Paul has a similar style at the start of all his letters.
