## Analysis

#### Words
- **Father** — [[God the Father]] is mentioned eight times in Ephesians.  The use here links to the end where the Father is mentioned again ([[Ephesians/6/23|6/23]]).
- **spiritual** — This very Pauline word is found three times in Ephesians ([[Ephesians/5/19|5/19]] & [[Ephesians/6/12|6/12]]).  It is not used in the LXX and Peter uses it only once ([[1 Peter/2/5]]).
- **heavenly** — The first of five mentions by Paul in this letter ([[Ephesians/1/20|1/20]], [[Ephesians/2/6|2/6]], [[Ephesians /3/10|3/10]] & [[Ephesians/6/12|6/12]]).

#### Phrases
- **blessed ... has blessed ... blessing** — Paul packs all his words from this one root into one verse.
