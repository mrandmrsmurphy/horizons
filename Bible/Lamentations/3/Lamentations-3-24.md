- **The LORD is my portion** â€” That's said of the Levites: They have no land, so Yahweh is their portion and inheritance ([[Numbers/18/20]]). By driving Israel from the land, Yahweh makes them all Levites, all priests, who all have Yahweh as their portion.[http://www.leithart.com/2010/11/12/priesthood-of-faithful/]
