## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases

#### Concepts
- **tone** â€” Clearly, Yahweh ''did'' command Israel to sacrifice whole-burnt offerings and the other sacrifices, in Leviticus etc.  So what is going on here?  A tone of voice would make this clear, but perhaps the printed word "just" could be inserted here as interpretation: 'I didn't just command you about sacrifices, because I was clearly talking about your hearts too.'
