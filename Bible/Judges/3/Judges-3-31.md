## Analysis

Other Greek manuscripts read καὶ μετὰ τοῦτον ἀνέστη Σαμεγαρ υἱὸς Αναθ καὶ ἐπάταξεν τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους εἰς ἑξακοσίους ἄνδρας ἐκτὸς μόσχων τῶν βοῶν καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτὸς τὸν Ισραηλ

#### Words
- **[[Shamgar]]** — His name only occurs here and in [[Judges/5/6]].  Hebrew words are all based on three letter groups, so these four strong letters (s-m-g-r) suggests foreign origin.
