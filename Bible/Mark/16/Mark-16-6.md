## Analysis

#### Words
- **amazed** — the angel seems all the more uncanny because it uses the same word which [[John Mark]] - the omniscient, third-person narrator - used in the [[Mark/16/5|last verse]].

#### Phrases
- **he is not here** — the angel does not say what false prophets say, "Here is the Christ." ([[Mark/13/21]])
- **the place where they laid him** — Joseph of Aramathia must have had help in [[Mark/15/46|15/46]].
