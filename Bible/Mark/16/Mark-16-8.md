## Analysis

#### Words
- **fled** — same as the young man naked in [[Mark/14/52|14:52]]
- **amazement** — same as the crowd in [[Mark/5/42|5:42]]

#### Phrases
- **came out ... from the tomb** — this phrase connects this verse with [[Mark/5/2|5:2]]
- **(women) trembling ... fear/afraid** — the same terror came upon she who was cured in [[Mark/5/33|5:33]], but she found her voice
- **They said nothing to anyone** — Greek permits the double negative that Project does not, except in crude colloquialisms: "they said nothing to nobody"
