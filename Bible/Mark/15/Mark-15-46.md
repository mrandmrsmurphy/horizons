## Analysis

#### Words
- **linen cloth** — the two uses here parallel [[Mark/14/51|14:51]] & [[Mark/14/52|52]].

#### Phrases
- **laid him in a tomb** — or ''laid him down in a sepulcher''.  With slight modifications, this is the same as John the Baptist's disciples did for him in [[Mark/6/29|6:29]].  Jesus' own disciples were too afraid.
