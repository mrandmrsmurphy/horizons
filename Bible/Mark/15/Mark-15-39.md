## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **son of God** — parallels [[Mark/1/1]] and [[Mark/9/7]], the author's and God's own confessions, forming an ''inclusio'' across the entire book, and tying the three acts of this gospel together.
- **expired like this** — or ''breathed his last thusly''.  That is, what the centurion saw as part of the death of Christ is what is sandwiched between the two uses of this rare verb (ἐκπνέω), the tearing of the temple veil.

#### Concepts

## Reflections

* The first confession of Jesus after the resurrection comes from a Gentile, a Roman centurion.  Perhaps this was meant to give encouragement to Mark's Roman audience.
