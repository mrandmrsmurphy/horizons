## Analysis

#### Words
- **beginning** — This word ([[Help:Greek:ΑΡΧΗ|ἀρχη]]) hearkens back to the opening of the entire Bible. ([[Genesis/1/1]],[[John/1/1]])
- **[[gospel]]** — ([[Help:Greek:ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ|εὐαγγελιον]]) The announcement of the birth or the enthronement of an emperor, or even his visit to a place would have been heralded as "good news" or "gospel".  Mark avoids [[Help:Greek:ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΖΩ|εὐαγγελίζω]] ("to proclaim the gospel"), common in Matthew and Luke.
- **Jesus** — Yeshua, means "Yahweh Saves".  Many in the Hispanic world who are named Jesus, and so it was in the Lord's own day. It means a great deal to us now, but it would not have distinguished Jesus much at the time.
- **Christ** — Anointed, Messiah. This would have gotten everyone's attention.  Mark is saying that this Jesus of Nazareth is no one other than the long awaited descendant of David who would bring deliverance to Israel and the people of God and establish God's Kingdom in the world.

#### Phrases
- **Gospel of Jesus** — Does the opening phrase "Gospel of Jesus Christ" mean the Gospel about Jesus, or the Gospel preached by Jesus? Or some combination of both? Weeden (1971) along with other exegetes, argues that for the writer of Mark, Jesus is the Gospel.
- **Son of God** — Mark's preferred title for Jesus, perhaps mostly clearly signifying that '''He is of the Nature of God'''. (cf. [[Mark/1/11|1/11]]; [[Mark/3/11|3/11]]; [[Mark/8/38|8/38]]; [[Mark/9/7|9/7]]; [[Mark/12/6|12/6]]; [[Mark/13/32|13/32]]; [[Mark/14/36|14/36]], [[Mark/14/61|61]]; [[Mark/15/39|15/39]]).

#### Concepts

The term "gospel" (εὐαγγελίου) seems to have been in general use as part of a standard phrase Ἀρχὴ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου (the beginning of the gospel) known from proclamations and inscriptions from the time of Augustus. The phrase "Son of God" (υἱοῦ Θεοῦ) was also used of Roman emperors (Helms 1988, p28-9). Craig Evans (2000, p69-70) offers a translation of one such inscription, the ''Priene Inscription'':
<blockquote>"It seemed good to the Greeks of Asia, in the opinion of the high priest Apollonius of Menophilus Azanitus: "Since Providence, which has ordered all things and is deeply interested in our life, has set in most perfect order by giving us Augustus, whom she filled with virtue that he might benefit humankind, sending him as a savior [σωτήρ], both for us and for our descendants, that he might end war and arrange all things, and since he, Caesar, by his appearance [ἐπιφανεῖν] (excelled even our anticipations), surpassing all previous benefactors, and not even leaving to posterity any hope of surpassing what he has done, and since the birthday of the god Augustus was the beginning of the good tidings for the world that came by reason of him ,"which Asia resolved in Smyrna..."</blockquote>
Evans observes:
<blockquote>"Comparison of Mark's incipit with this part of the inscription seems fully warranted. First, there is reference to good news, or 'gospel. In Mark the word appears in the singular, while in the inscription it probably appears twice in the more conventional plural. Secondly, there is reference to the beginning of this good news. In Mark the nominal form is employed, while in the inscription the verbal form is employed. Thirdly, this good news is brought about by a divine agent. In Mark this agent is 'Jesus the Anointed', (either in the incipit, or as declared elsewhere in the Markan Gospel), while in the inscription the agent is 'Augustus', the 'savior' and 'benefactor'...."
