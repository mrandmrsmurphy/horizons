## Analysis

#### Words
- **LORD** — the writer of Mark ensures that the reader knows Jesus is the Son of God. The "messianic secret" is a secret only from other characters in the story; the reader is in on it at the beginning.

#### Phrases
- **The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make <s>his</s> paths straight.** — [[Isaiah/40/3]] from the LXX, to the letter up to the last word (his).
