## Analysis

#### Phrases
- **a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins** â€” directly contradicted by the Jewish historian Josephus:	''Antiquites of the Jews 18.5.2'' "Now, some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John, that was called the Baptist; for Herod slew him, who was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so come for baptism; for that the washing would be acceptable to him, if they made use of it, not in order to the remission of some sins, but for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness."
