## Analysis

Despite the introductory accreditation of Isaiah, this verse is a quote of [[Exodus/23/20]]/[[Malachi/3/1]].Although the writer of Mark is often accused of "error" in reference to the scriptures at this point (the citation is from Malachi rather than Isaiah), as some commentators have noted, the first two verses may form a complete statement: ''The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet.'' with reference to [[Isaiah/40/9]].

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **Look, I send my messenger before your face,** — This is an exact quote from the LXX translation of [[Exodus/23/20]].
- **who will prepare your way** — this is either Mark's translation or another translation of the OT, other than the LXX.
