## Analysis

- **like silver** — "The [[Ugaritic]] lexicon can also have text-critical implications in the study of the Hebrew Bible.  For example, in the Masoretic text of Proverbs 26:23, we find the expression, כֶּסֶף סִיגִים, which might be translated with the meaningless, 'silver lips'.  Scholars have pondered the meaning of this expression in its context.  As it turns out, Ugaritic has the term ''spsg'', from which we can deduce that the much later Masoretic scribe, who no longer understood the text, erroneously divided the original word into two words that the scribe understood (even so the resulting larger text made no sense.)  By recombining the two words we get כספסיגים (i.e. k + spsg) which means 'like silver'.  This emendation, which was made possible by the discovery of the Ugaritic tablets makes sense out of a previously nonsensical text."<ref>William M. Schniedewind, Joel H.
