## Analysis

#### Words
- **oracle** — an amazing thing to call words of an unbelieving queen-mother to king/son, presumably before he even came into contact with Israel.  Wisdom is the key for being the renewed humanity, wherever it comes from.<ref>[[Jack Collins]], ''Presbyterion'' XXXV/Spring 2009 No.1, p12</ref>

#### Phrases
- **of king Lemuel** — The Masoretic text reads לְמוּאֵל מֶלֶךְ, which then speaks of a king nowhere else mentioned.  The LXX suggests that we have some corruption in our text before 200 B.C., as it has "My words have been spoken by God — the oracular answer of a king, whom his mother instructed."
