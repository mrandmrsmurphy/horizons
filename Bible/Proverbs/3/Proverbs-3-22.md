## Analysis

#### Words
- **soul** â€” There is a pun here in Hebrew which is impossible to render into other languages.  The word for 'soul' can also mean 'neck' or 'throat', which would neatly parallel the more obvious word for neck at the end of the verse.  Wisdom and Prudence are here held up as metaphorical necklaces for the body and garlands for one's eternal character.
