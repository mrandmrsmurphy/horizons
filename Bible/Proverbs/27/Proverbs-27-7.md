## Analysis

#### Words
- **soul** â€” A complex pun is going on here in Hebrew that is impossible to render into English.  The word 'soul' also means 'throat' and 'desire'.  We don't speak of someone's throat being 'full' in English (instead we speak of the belly), but Solomon is here illustrating something ''psychological'' with something physiological.
