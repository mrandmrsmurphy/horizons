Peter Leithart:
This verse is structured as a chiasm, completed by a brief one-line reversal:

A. Whoever causes-to-stray

B. The upright

C. In the way of evil

C’. In a pit

B’. of his

A’. He will fall.

D. But the perfect inherit good.

The structure underscores the reversal predicted for the anyone who causes people to go astray.  At the beginning of the proverb, the one is presumably leading, with enough influence to determine which way the upright will go; at the end of the proverb, he falls.  The B sections are perhaps not distinction sections, since “his” is merely a pronominal suffix.  If they are seen as separate sections, though, then we have a contrast between the upright’s destiny and the destiny of the one who is causing them to go away from the right way.  It’s not the upright who fall into the pit, but their leader.  The central section describes the aim, and the actual end, of the one who causes the upright to go astray: He leads them in the way of evil, but at the end of that way of evil is a pit.

What is the picture here?  The pit is “his” pit, and that suggests that the man leading the upright astray intended to lead them to destruction.  “Come follow me,” he says, as he leads them into a trap.  The proverb is saying that the man who leads astray will himself fall into the pit that he’s dug for others (a common theme of cartoons, and the Bible: Psalm 7:15; 57:6; Proverbs 26:27; Ecclesiastes 10:8).  The one who leads astray is not hearing torah , which requires a man who digs a pit to cover it and protect against a fall (Exodus 21:23). Instead, this man is trying to lead people to the pit, so that they can fall into it.

Are the “upright” rescued?  It seems so.  The pit is, again, “his,” and he is the only one who falls (the verb is singular).  If we are to link the upright and the “perfect” at the end of the verse, we are given two destinies.  The false leader falls, while the upright/perfect are rescued from the pit and inherit good.  That suggests an alternative structure:

A. Whoever causes-to-stray the upright in the way of evil

B. In his pit he will fall.

A’. But the perfect

B’. inherit good.

A form of the verb “lead astray” ( shagah ) is used in Leviticus 4:13 to describe sins of wandering or ignorance.  This is not a high-handed sin, but a sin of deception, ignorance, confusion.  The proverb gives us a specific scenario involving such a sin: A sin of ignorance or wandering may be one that is “caused” by another, that is, one in which we are encouraged by someone we think trustworthy to sin.  Sins of ignorance are removed in sacrifice.  They are not counted as defiant, high-handed sins.  Scripture, in short, recognizes degrees and varieties of sin.  Sins are always sins, but sometimes sinners are victims as well as perpetrators.

This not only encourages gentleness in dealing with wandering sinners, but also places a great deal of responsibility on leaders.  A leader can cause upright people to go astray; a leader can attempt to lead upright people into a pit, and he’s the one who will fall into it, not them.

Jesus is the upright one.  He committed no sin, not even a sin of ignorance or wandering.  Still, he took our infirmities and sins on Himself; He took even the infirmities and sins of high-handed sinners who set traps for others.  He came to His own to redeem them.  Though He never followed the way of evil, He ended up in the pit.  But His Father rescued Him from the pit, exalted Him, and He became heir of all things, of all good.
