## Analysis

#### Words
- **blameless** — a sacrificial term, used frequently to describe the “blemish-less” animals that were to be offered on the altar ([[Leviticus/1/3]], 10; 3:1; 6, 9; 22:19, 21etc), as well as the priests who were to bring the offerings.  The man who is without blemish is the one who is suitable for sacrifice.  As Toby Sumpter pointed out in his sermons on Job, the blameless or blemish-less man shouldn’t expect a trouble-free life.  The blameless man is suitable for sacrifice, suitable to be brought near and transformed to smoke.  That is a good thing.  To be a sacrifice is to be “eaten” into Yahweh’s cloud and fire, to be transformed and incorporated into the Triune life.  That is the way the blameless man is saved (yasha’ is the verb).[http://www.leithart.com/2010/02/18/proverbs-2817-19/]
