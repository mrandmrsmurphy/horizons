## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **to show partiality** — translates a Hebrew idiom that means, literally, to have regard for or to recognize one’s face.  Face is associated with presence and person, and so with reputation.  Finding favor in another's presence is finding favor in their eyes or before their face, having access to their presence because they are favorably disposed to you.  To recognize a face is to defer to someone’s reputation. [http://www.leithart.com/2010/02/19/proverbs-2820-21/]
