Peter Leithart:
Again Solomon speaks of our attitude toward torah .  The central command of the law was a command to “hear” (Deuteronomy 6).  It was a command addressed to the ear.  We are to have open ears (Psalm 40; Isaiah 50:5) so that we can obey His commandments.  The connection between hearing and obeying is so close that sometimes the Bible uses the verb “hear” as a synonym for “obey.”  Not hearing is disobedience; eventually, Israel is sent into exile for “not hearing” the words of the prophets (2 Kings 17:14).

Ears set the direction of our lives.  Ears determine which way we turn.  Moses warns the people not to turn their hearts toward other gods are refuse to hear (Deuteronomy 30:17).

When we turn our ears to the Word of Yahweh, the word that urges us to repentance, that leads us to turn from a way of wickedness and being to live (Jeremiah 35:15; 44:5).  Jesus (Matthew 13:15) and Paul (Acts 28:27) condemn the Jews using the words of Isaiah: Their ear cannot hear, their eyes cannot see, and therefore they cannot understand and their hearts cannot turn back to the Lord.

The thrust of the proverb is to describe the effects of turning our ears from Yahweh’s word in the torah .  The one who refuses to hear the law, to listen and obey, becomes an abomination to Yahweh.  An abomination, as we’ve often remarked, is something that Yahweh spews from His mouth.  Prayers are good; we are commanded to pray, but even good things can become detestable to Yahweh if they are not done in obedience.  Solomon has made this point before, contrasting the abominable sacrifice of the wicked with the pleasing prayer of the righteous (Proverbs 15:8).

This is fitting: If anyone refuses to listen to Yahweh, Yahweh will refuse to listen to his prayers.  If he turns a deaf ear to Yahweh, Yahweh will in turn a deaf ear to him.  Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, deaf ear for deaf ear.  That reversal is not confined to our prayers to God.  We can find reflections of this in human life.  A child who refuses to hear his parents will not be heard by them; an employee who continually bucks his employer’s instructions will have a hard time getting heard; a church member who won’t listen is not going to have much clout with the elders.  Open ear meets open ear, but closed ears meet closed ears.  That’s the way God made the world.
