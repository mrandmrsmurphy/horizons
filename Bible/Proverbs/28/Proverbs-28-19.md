## Analysis

#### Words
- **till** — Tilling is abad, to serve, and is the verb used in Genesis 2 to describe Adam’s original vocation and in the Pentateuch to describe the tabernacle service of the Levitical priests.  Priests as “Adams” in the garden of the tabernacle, tilling the soil of the tabernacle to produce fruit, tilling the soil of Israel so that Israel would be productive and pleasing to her Lord.
- **land** — not eretz, but adamah, ground, the word etymologically related to Adam.  Again, we have a reflection on the fall of Adam.  Adam was to guard and serve the adamah from which he was taken.  He failed to serve well, and so instead of being full of bread he was cast out of the garden, driven from the tree of life, and thrown into a condition of poverty.s
- **fantasies** — sometimes translated as “empty” is reyq and in its literal uses it means empty, starving or thin ([[Genesis/41/27]]).  Tilling land, serving the garden, diligent work in one’s own place, is the way to prosperity and plenty.  But many people want something quick, and want a lot of it, and that kind of pursuit will end badly.  Even if they get all that they think they want, they will find it empty in the end.  Though the wording is different, the Bible often used the terminology of “emptiness” and “vanity” to describe idols and their effects.  Chasing idols, especially the idol of money and wealth, is chasing nothing, chasing emptiness, and will leave you empty.[http://www.leithart.com/2010/02/18/proverbs-2817-19/]
