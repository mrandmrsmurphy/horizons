## Analysis

#### Words
- **hastens** — Proverbs warns against hastiness in several places.  Hastiness leads to error ([[Proverbs/19/2]]) and to poverty ([[Proverbs/21/5]]).  Hasty words make a man worse than a fool ([[Proverbs/29/20]]).  Here, the warning is more somber.  The hasty will not only come to poverty, but will be guilty.  The one who is driven to get rich will cut corners, ignore the needs of others, trample on the weak who stand in his way, and cannot remain pure.
- **unpunished** — The verb translated as “go unpunished” is frequently translated as “be pure” ([[Exodus/20/7]]).  What is implied a Punisher: The proverb is not talking about a “natural” cause-and-effect, but rather the fact that the Lord will intervene to discipline those who are hasty and unthinking in their pursuit of wealth.[http://www.leithart.com/2010/02/19/proverbs-2820-21/]
