Peter Leithart:

Eyes are organs of judgment in Scripture.  Everything is open and laid bare before the eyes of the one with whom we have to do.  Our true worth and standing is determined by how we stand in the eyes of Yahweh.  But we cannot help but make judgments about ourselves.  We all use “mirrors” of one sort or another, trying to form a self-judgment.  James encourages us to look into the mirror of the law of liberty, and gain an accurate self-judgment there.  It is wrong to look at the mirror and then turn away, forgetting what kind of persons we are.

But we’re constantly inclined to do so.  We don’t want to look in the mirror of the law, which is going to condemn us.  We want to look into the mirror of our own judgment.  At the heart of original sin is our refusal to accept God’s evaluation of us; we want to be our own judges, and be right in our own eyes.  The wicked “flatters himself in his own eyes” (Psalm 36:2).  Proverbs regularly returns to this theme of self-judgment.  “Do not be wise in your own eyes” (3:7); the fool thinks he is “right in his own eyes” (12:15); everything sees his own ways are pure (16:2); we are to answer a fool after his folly to keep him from being wise in his own eyes (26:5); a man who is wise in his own eyes is even worse than a fool (26:12); lazy people are wiser in their own eyes than men who answer sensibly (26:16).

28:11 is a variation on this theme, focusing attenti
on not on the fool who is wise in his own eyes, but on the rich man who is wise in his own eyes.  Wealth blinds us.  Wealth entices us to look not in the mirror of the law but in the mirror of our portfolio.  If I’ve made such a bundle of money, the rich man says, I must be something special; I must be very shrewd, very skillful, very wise.  Yahweh warned Israel that when they entered the land they would be tempted to take credit for their wealth: “My power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth” (Deuteronomy 7:17).

Solomon says the poor man sees quite through the rich man.  A poor man with discrimination and good judgment knows the rich man better than he knows himself.  The verb “search” can be used in judicial contexts to mean something like “investigate” (Deuteronomy 13:14; Judges 18:2).  The rich man judges himself wise, but the true investigation and evaluation of his worth is not his but the poor man with discernment.

Yahweh is the one who searches out the heart, and tries the reins (Jeremiah 17:10).  This takes an interesting twist with the incarnation.  For our sakes the God who has all things and made all things became poor.  He became the poor but discerning man who rightly evaluates the rich.  The incarnate Son judges with the discernment of one who looks from below.
