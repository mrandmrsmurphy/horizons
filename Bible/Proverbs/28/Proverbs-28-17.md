## Analysis

#### Words
- **man** — Again, the proverb uses the word adam, and again we are put in mind of the sin of the first man.  Adam’s sin was an act of impatience and rebellion against Yahweh’s commandment, but here the “adam” is acting violently, shedding innocent blood.  Was the first man’s sin also an act of violence?  Not in any obvious way.  But after his sin, he immediately separates himself from God and from Eve, and even becomes Eve’s accuser.  Perhaps we can also see his failure to protect Eve from the serpent’s temptation as an implicit act of oppression.[http://www.leithart.com/2010/02/18/proverbs-2817-19/]
- **burdened** — The verb translated in the NAS as “laden with guilt” is ‘ashaq, which means oppress, treat unjustly, act violently.  Scripture particularly forbids violent acts against the weak and helpless ([[Proverbs/14/31]]; [[Jeremiah/7/6]]; [[Zechariah/7/10]]).  Oppression is often paired with robbery {{mdash}} it takes the form of assaults not only on persons but on property ([[Leviticus/6/2]], [[Leviticus/6/4|4]]; [[Leviticus/19/13|19:13]]; [[Deuteronomy/24/14]]; [[Deuteronomy/28/39|28:39]]; {{LV|1 Samuel|12|3|4}}; [[Ezekiel/22/29]]; [[Hosea/5/11]]).  Israel hoped for a king greater than Solomon, who would take up the cause of the poor and crush the oppressor ([[Psalm/72/4]]), a king would carry out Yahweh’s own program of executing justice for the oppressed ([[Psalm/146/7]]).
- **pit** — The violent, as always in Scripture, are foiled.  Those who oppress and abuse and set traps for others will end up falling into the pit themselves.  Solomon depicts the bloody man running headlong toward his destruction, not realizing that the pit lies in front of him.  In the episode where [[Joseph sold into slavery]], this word is used seven times, and the same word is translated as “dungeon” later in the story ([[Genesis/40/15]]; [[Genesis/41/14|41:14]]).  Joseph's brothers are men of blood, violent oppressors, but they do not fall into the pit.  Joseph does instead, and later forgives them.  They don't rush into the pit, but escape it, but it is because a substitute has taken their place.  Joseph is a Christ figure, a type of the one who is oppressed until He sheds the blood of His soul, who is thrown into the pit that should be reserved for the violent, but who is finally brought up out of the pit and installed as King over all.

#### Phrases
- **do not help him** — What should be done for the oppressor?  The proverb instructs us to keep our hands off him.  He’s rushing toward destruction, and we should let him go, not holding him back from the consequences of his sin.  That is certainly the way the Lord often works, judging men not by stopping them in our flight to destruction but judging them by delivering us over to our flight, by removing the obstacles that would hold us back.  If you are held back from the pit, it’s because the Lord has set up an obstacle in the way.  Be grateful.
