## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **advancing in Judaism** — one might have expected Paul to say he advanced in the ''Law'', but that is something he would've been proud of!  It is the traditions of men that he has turned from, not the Law itself.
- **traditions of my fathers** — this is the Verbal Torah/Mishnah as opposed to the Written Torah, or the actual Word of God.
