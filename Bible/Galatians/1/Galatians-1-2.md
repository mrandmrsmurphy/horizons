## Analysis

#### Words
- **brothers** — the Greek word means a group which can include women.
- **all** — Did every, single human being accompanying Paul concur with him on every, single point he writes about?  Almost certainly not.  But yet the consensus is with him so overwhelmingly that he can say "all".
- **<s>saints</s>** — Paul does not call them "saints" or holy ones, as he does in all his other letters except Thessalonians.  He does not mention 'love' or call them 'beloved'.
- **assemblies** — trad. churches.  This is the only letter explicitly stated to be written to a collection of churches.

#### Phrases
- **all the brothers with me** — Paul is not writing as an individual citizen, but as an apostle.  Hence, the Church stands behind all he says.  see also Chrysostom NPNF 13:4 (PG 61:616).

#### Concepts
- **with or without support** — Paul adds a phrase about the brethren with him being part of the "from" of the letter.  Yet throughout the epistle, Paul is defending is apostleship as not dependent on anyone.  This statement must be viewed as neither a support for nor a detraction from his authority.
