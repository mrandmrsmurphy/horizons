## Analysis

#### Words
- **brothers** — another parallel with/1/1.

#### Phrases
- **not according to man** — corresponds to [[Galatians/1/1|1:1]]'s "neither through man"
- **the gospel which was preached** — the English words hide that fact that the words are of the same root in Greek, i.e. "the gospel that was gospelled" or "the evangel that was evangelized"
