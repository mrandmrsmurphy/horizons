## Analysis

#### Words
- **[[Apostle Paul|Paul]]** — The Great Apostle to the Gentiles was known to his audience: he had met them in person not long before.
- **[[apostle]]** — There is a generic meaning possible for the word -- that of a "sent one" in general.  But here it is a 'capitol A' sense of the word, as in "The Twelve Apostles".  Paul, of course, meaning the latter.
- **not** — As the third of the letter, this word sets the tone: polemical!
- **<s>servant</s>** — a common word for Paul in a epistle opening, he does not use it here, presumably because he is '''''not''''' submitting to the Galatians in anything relating to the discussion.

#### Phrases
- **Paul&#58; Apostle** — The words are right next to each other in the Greek (where there is no possible word 'an').  He write this way in five other epistle openings ([[2 Corinthians/1/1]], [[Ephesians/1/1]], [[Colossians/1/1]], [[1 Timothy/1/1]], [[2 Timothy/1/1]]) but there is a strong sense of ''assertion'' here in Galatians.
- **from men** — Paul means that no (mere) human being is the cause of his apostleship.
- **through man** — ...
- **men ... man** — the contrast between plural and singular seems to indicate the 11 other Apostles and their emissary.
- **from ... through** — Paul uses these two prepositions together (cp. [[2 Corinthians/1/16]], [[Romans/5/9]], [[Romans/15/15|15/15]]) to indicate source and means.

#### Concepts
- **Apostleship** — Paul list two negatives and then two positives for his origin.  But he concludes his parenthetical statement with the ultimate validation of Christ: his resurrection.  Coming back from the dead permanently is the unique statement of Jesus' final authority in all matters.  If Paul is the "sent one", the ambassador of such as one as that, then he speaks the words of eternal and absolute authority.
- **Trinity** — Jesus and the Father are listed separately, and yet are one.
