## Analysis

#### Words
- **as the Nations** — this is all one word in Greek: "Gentile-ly"?  It occurs nowhere else.
- **as the Jews** — this is all one word in Greek: Jewishly?  It occurs nowhere else.
- **to Judaize/to live as do the Jews** — this rare word is found only here and in the LXX of [[Esther/8/17]].  The meaning appear to be "to (outwardly) conform to Jewish practice".

#### Phrases
- **are as the Nations are** — What can it mean? removed the marks of circumcision? eating pork or other forbidden food? disobeying the moral laws in Torah? no longer saying the prayers? Far and away the most likely solution is that in one of two ways Peter is no longer observing standard Jewish taboos.<ref>N.T. Wright, ''Justification''</ref>
