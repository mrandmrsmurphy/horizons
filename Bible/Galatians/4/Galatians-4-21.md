## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **under law ... the Law** â€” Paul employs two different meaning of the word "law" in this verse, one generally meaning 'legal' and the other cognate with how we today use 'Torah' (i.e. the first five books of the Bible).  The latter is plain because he goes on to quote Genesis, but from a time before the Mosaic Law.
