## Analysis

#### Words
- **alienate** — the Judaizers seek to arouse the Galatians to see association with them by shutting them out.  They shut the Galatians out so that those outside will clamor to get in.  A clever and recurring ploy in all sorts of groups. Paul uses the verb [[Help:Greek:ΕΚΚΛΕΙΩ|ἐκκλείω]], a transparent pun on [[Help:Greek:ΕΚΚΛΗΣΙΑ|ἐκκλησία]]/church.  The church of Jesus has a table at the center; it is a place of hospitality.  A church that shuts out, or a party within the church that shuts out, has become an anti-church.[http://www.leithart.com/2010/11/30/shut-out/]
