## Analysis

#### Words
- **working** — literally ''in-working''.  This is quite a change given Paul's endless ''ad hominem'' attacks against work throughout this book.

#### Phrases
- **neither circumcision nor uncircumcision count for anything but** — cp. [[1 Corinthians/7/19]] and [[Galatians/6/15]]
