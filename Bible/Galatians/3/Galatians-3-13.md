## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree** — [[Deuteronomy/21/23]].  In Deuteronomy, it is literally "accursed is everyone who hangs on a tree".  The first word is synonymous.  Here is is the adjective [[Help:Greek:ΕΠΙΚΑΤΑΡΑΤΟΣ|ἐπικατάρατος]], but in the LXX it is the verb [[Help:Greek:ΚΑΤΑΡΑΟΜΑΙ|καταράομαι]] in the perfect-middle-participle (a verbal adjective).  The meaning is basically equivalent.
