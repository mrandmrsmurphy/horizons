## Analysis

#### Words
- **faith** — personal, subjective faith, just like in the previous verse.  The definite article is anaphoric, referencing v22's faith in Jesus Christ.
- **kept** — In other contexts, it can be positive, but here with "confined" (which is made even more negative by its use in the previous verse) it must mean "to guard a prisoner".
- **confined** — this confinement is not over for those without faith ([[Romans/11/32]])
- **we** — this is not some identification with the pre-Mosaic Jews, but a description of Paul's own state before believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.

#### Phrases
- **under Torah** — an apparently Pauline-only phrase ([[Galatians/4/4]],[[Galatians/4/5|5]],[[Galatians/5/18|5/18]]; [[1 Corinthians/9/20]], [[Romans/6/14]],[[Romans/6/15|15]]) in opposition to "under grace"
