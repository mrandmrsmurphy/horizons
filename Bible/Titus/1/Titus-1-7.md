## Analysis

#### Words
- **blameless** — This word was used in the previous verse as a pre-qualification for overseers.
- **steward** — This was a common enough word for "managers" and the like in the time.  Paul uses it of apostles in [[1 Corinthians/4/1]]ff, as does Peter in [[1 Peter/4/10]].
- **self-pleasing** — Or "self-willed".  Peter uses it in a list of the vices of unsaved in [[2 Peter/2/10]].  (The LXX uses it in [[Genesis/49/3]] and vv.7, where it describes Jacob's disobedient sons, and [[Proverbs/21/24]] as way to say "haughty".)
- **irascible** — used only here in the GNT, it is related to the word for "anger" quite closely.
- **given to wine** — Paul used the exact same verbiage in [[1 Timothy/3/3]] (another description of the qualifications of an overseer)
- **violet** — Paul used the exact same verbiage in [[1 Timothy/3/3]] (another description of the qualifications of an overseer)
- **greedy for dishonest gain** — The first half of this word is a word in [[Titus/1/11|verse 11]], it could also be translated "shameful gainers".  The adverbial form is used in [[1 Peter/5/2]].  Paul used the exact same verbiage in [[1 Timothy/3/3]] (another description of the qualifications of a deacon).
