## Analysis

#### Words
- **blameless** — Here, Paul seems to be saying this is a qualification for consideration to the office of overseer.  He repeats it in the next verse, and it is listed in the qualifications for deacon in [[1 Timothy/3/10]].  It is also used of believers more generally in [[Colossians/1/22]] and [[1 Corinthians/1/8]].
- **accused/accusation** — Here, it is the children of elders who must not have any accusations.  Elsewhere this word is used about Elders, where Paul advises not even receiving an accusation without weighty evidence ([[1 Timothy/5/19]]).  It cannot mean no accusations have ever happened, since the same word is used by Pilate to describe what the Jews are bringing against Jesus in [[John/18/29]].
- **prodigality** — Etymologically, this word is composed of "un+saved" and often is associated with drunkenness, real or metaphorical.  [[Ephesians/5/18]] directly mentions that, whereas [[1 Peter/4/4]] is talking more of riotous behavior, which seems also to be in few in [[Proverbs/28/7]] in the LXX.  (That verse is a unique translation of זָלַל in the masculine plural active participle.)
- **unsubmissive** — Paul will use this word of the Opposition Party in [[Titus/1/10|verse 10]] and [[1 Timothy/1/9]].  In [[Hebrews/2/8]], it seems to be more about the now-and-not-yet total reign of Christ.

#### Phrases
- **husband of one wife** — Repeated in [[1 Timothy/3/2]], this phrase could mean 1) no polygamists are allowed, 2) the man must be moral pure, or 3) no divorcés
