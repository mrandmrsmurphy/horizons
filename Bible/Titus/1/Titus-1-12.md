## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.** — from a poem by Epimenides the Cretan, also cited in [[Acts/17/28]].

#### Concepts

The Epimenides paradox is a problem in logic. It is named after the Cretan philosopher Epimenides of Knossos (alive circa 600 BC), There is no single statement of the problem; a typical variation is given in the book Gödel, Escher, Bach, by Douglas Hofstadter:

Epimenides was a Cretan who made one immortal statement: "All Cretans are liars."

A paradox of self-reference is commonly supposed to arise when one considers whether Epimenides spoke the truth. However, if Epimenides knew of at least one Cretan (other than himself) who was not a liar, then his statement is a non-paradoxical lie in that it does not lead to a logical contradiction. (The contradictory of the statement, "All Cretans are liars" is the statement, "Some Cretans are not liars", which might be true at the same time as the statement, "Some Cretans are liars.")

## Reflections

<poem>
 They fashioned a tomb for thee, O holy and high one
 The Cretans, always liars, evil beasts, idle bellies!
 But thou art not dead: thou livest and abidest forever,
 For in thee we live and move and have our being.

– Epimenides, Cretica
