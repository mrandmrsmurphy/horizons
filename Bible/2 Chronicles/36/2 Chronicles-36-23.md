## Analysis

#### Words
- **go up** â€” Apart from Judges, no book of the Hebrew Bible ends in a verb.  And the verb is 'arise'!  Don't forget, Chronicles was written long after the People had been in the Land.  They knew that entry into a territory was not enough.  As the last book of the Hebrew canon, this ending is eschatological.
