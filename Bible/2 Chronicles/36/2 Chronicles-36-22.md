## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **stir up** — Near the beginning of 1 Chronicles, Yahweh stirs up the spirit of Pul of Assyria to invade and conquer Israel ([[1 Chronicles/5/26]]). Near the end, He stirs up the spirit of Cyrus of Persia to issue a decree sending the exiles home.  Israel's intervening history is framed by those two divine “stirrings.”  The heart of the king is in Yahweh's hand.[http://www.leithart.com/2010/03/04/stirred-spirits/]
