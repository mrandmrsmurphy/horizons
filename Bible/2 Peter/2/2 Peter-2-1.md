## Analysis

#### Words
- **bought** â€” Just as it is used in, say, [[1 Corinthians/6/20]], this word refers to a kind of redemption, being bought (out of bondage) at a price.  Just as all Israel was brought from Pharaoh's house but not all of them made it to the Promised Land, so too with the Church.  Not all who are initially saying, "Lord, Lord!" will make it to the end.
