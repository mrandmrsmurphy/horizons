## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **my God** — literally ''the God of me'' underlines the personal character of Paul's devotion.
- **always ... remember ... prayer** — We should not regard this as mere literary flourish; Paul must have had an extensive prayer list and presumably spent some time each day naming before God all his churches, colleagues, and supporters.  This would help maintain and strengthen the sense of a faith shared with 'all the saints'.
