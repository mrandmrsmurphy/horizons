## Analysis

#### Words
- **Timothy** — Paul's primary traveling companion and understudy.  He was probably not actually much involved in the letter, but is listed here as a formality, to indicate the apostolic authority of the author.
- **Kindly/Philemon** — His name is related to the word for 'love' or 'kindness'.  It is only every used here in this verse.

#### Phrases
- **Jesus Christ** — [[Help:Greek:ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ]]
