## Analysis

### Words
- **Apphia** — is assumed to be Philemon's wife.
- **Archippus** — is taken to be Philemon's son.  Likely the same man mentioned in [[Colossians/4/17]].
- **fellow-soldier** — suggests that Archippus was active in the ministry in Colassae.

### Phrases
- **the church in your house** — this letter would have been read aloud to the entire church. Philemon was likely to recognize the church's right to take an interest in and even advise on the internal affairs of his own household.

### Concepts

## Reflections

* The character of their shared faith meant Philemon would receive advise publicly ([[Philemon/1/6|verse 6]]).  This is all the more striking since almost certainly slaves (Philemon's or others') would also be members of the house church (compare {{LV|Colossians|1|22|25}}).
