## Analysis

### Words
- **equally** — [[Help:Greek:ΙΣΟΣ|ισα]] is correctly parsed in all the texts as [[Help:Greek:NPN|Nominative Plural Neuter]], but that makes no sense in context.  It must be an [[adverb]], translatable only as "equally".

### Phrases
- **To exist equally with God** — the only fair way to translate the last phrase of the verse. "To be equal with God" uses 'equal' as an adjective.

### Concepts
- **[[Christology]], [[Trinity]]** — The [[Apostle Paul]] is telling us how Christ existed before taking on human flesh.  He was in every way equal with God the Father. He chose not to continue the kind of existence out of unselfishness, but instead lost all the trappings or ''appearance'' of God, though never ceasing ''to be'' God himself.
