## Analysis

#### Words
- **fellowship** — 'participation' in [[Philippians/1/5|1:5]] and [[Philippians/2/1|2:1]].  Together, these verses mean we participate in the gospel – have fellowship with the Spirit – through financial contributions to gospel ministry, Spirit-based participation in Christian unity with others, and shared suffering with the whole Church of God.
- **conformed** — related to the word 'form', as seen so importantly in {{LV/2|Philippians|2|6|8}}

#### Phrases

#### Concepts

## Reflections
- **resurrection ... suffering ... death** — Paul reverses the historical order because we need the power of the resurrection to maintain through the suffering.  The accent is on living under the banner of Christ crucified. <ref>Dr. Knox Chamberlain, ''[http://virtual.rts.edu/site/virtual/coursecatalog/newtestament.aspx Gospel and Acts]'', Mark III, ~3:30</ref>
