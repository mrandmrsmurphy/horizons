## Analysis

#### Words
- **true** — Truth comes first in this list.  As [[Romans/1]] say, everyone knows it, but many repress it.
- **lovely** — Aesthetic beauty is important to God.  This word is unique in the NT but it is used in the Apocrypha in an addition to Esther 5:1 to describe her face, and in Wisdom 20:13 to describe the beautiful words of the wise.
