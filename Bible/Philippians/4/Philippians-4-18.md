## Analysis

#### Words
- **Epaphroditus** — last mentioned in [[Philippians/2/25|2:25]], he appears in this epistle in backwards chronological order.  Here, Paul is describing the arrival of him, whereas earlier, he was talking about sending him back to the Philippians.
- **well-pleasing** — the adjective is unique to Paul, but the [[Help:Greek:ΕΥΑΡΕΣΤΕΩ|verb]] is common enough in Genesis.

#### Phrases
- **sweet smelling aroma** — This is a common phrase throughout the OT, as when Noah got off the Ark and made sacrifice to Yahweh.
