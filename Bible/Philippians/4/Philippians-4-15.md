## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **beginning of the gospel** â€” despite the obvious verbal similarities to [[Mark/1/1]], Aichele (2003) observes: "in the letter to the Philippians these words denote the beginnings of Paul's missionary activity and lack any hint of the self-referentiality of Mark 1:1.(p10)".  This seems to fly in the face of the fact that Mark was written a decade or so earlier.  Mark's Gospel is a call to action, and Paul seems to be saying he has answered that call, and the Philippians with him.
