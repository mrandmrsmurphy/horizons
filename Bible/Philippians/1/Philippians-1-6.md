## Analysis

#### Words
- **began ... in** — one word in Greek, it is not common in Paul's mouth, though the LXX uses it in the Hexateuch/Torah.
- **complete** — this is a fairly common word in Paul's mouth, perhaps over-translatable as "complete totally."  Used twice in [[2 Corinthians/8]].
- **am confident** — other "I am persuaded".  Used again in [[Philippians/1/14|1:14]], [[Philippians/2/24|2:24]], [[Philippians/3/3|3:3]] and 4.

#### Phrases
- **began in and complete** — Paul used this exact pairing of words in [[Galatians/3/3]] as an enormous rebuke.  They were wandering off into heresy, having "begun in" Christ, but now "finishing" in the realm of sinful Flesh.  Here we see the positive picture, that God sews the seed in believers' hearts and keeps working on it throughout this earthly epoch.
- **day of Christ** — this fascinating twist on the phrase "day of the Lord" is said for the first time here.  It comes back again in [[Philippians/1/10|1:10]] and [[Philippians/2/16|2:16]].
- **good works** — a key phrase in Paul, that he seems to have gotten from Jesus.  This phrase is similarly expressed in [[Philippians/2/16|2:16]].
