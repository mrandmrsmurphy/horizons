## Analysis

#### Words
- **<s>apostle</s>** — Unlike a lot of his epistles, Paul doesn't have to taut his apostolic authority to the Philippians; they receive him as such already.
- **slave** — while it is a humble term, this is more about the fact that Paul (and Timothy) is a "household slave" or "bond slave" of Yahweh, attached to him by having his heart (as opposed to his ear) 'circumcised' and attached to his 'household' forever.  See also ''TOM Homily on Philippians 2.1.1.-2.''
- **Timothy** — Paul's assistant is given credibility by being mentioned here, but he is also a second witness to add credibility to Paul's testimony.
- **overseer** — see elsewhere for the proof that this term is synonymous with "elder".
- **servant** — others "deacons".  These are ordained servants of the church, saints called to service, just like the Levites ministered in the Temple/Tabernacle.
- **Philippi** — Located on the major Roman road known as the Via Egnatia, Philippi was “a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony” ([[Acts/16/12]]). Because of its strategic location Philippi became a strategic location for trade despite the fact it was 13 km from Neapolis, the nearest sea port."

#### Phrases
- **slave of Jesus** — Just as Moses and Joshua were servants of God/Yahweh ([[Deuteronomy/34/5]], etc.) then David([[Psalm/18/0]], [[Psalm/36/0]], etc.), then Isaiah's Servant, and Mary [[Luke/1/38]], so Paul has this title as a point of privilege.
- **holy one** — others "saints".  We are all made holy by the blood of Jesus Christ, appropriated to ourselves through baptism.  Like the furniture or the sacrifices in the Old Covenant, we are in the category of 'holy things'.
- **in Christ** — no longer in Adam, we are in the Second Adam.
- **overseers and servants** — "elders and deacons" aren't laid out by Paul in great detail until [[2 Timothy/3]] or [[Titus/1]].  None the less, it seems to be working part of Early Church, as in [[Acts]].  It is the "session" which sent him money and Epaphroditus (TOM).
