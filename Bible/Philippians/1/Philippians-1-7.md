## Analysis

#### Words
- **think** — the first of eight times Paul uses this word in Philippians.
- **bonds** — that is, imprisonment.  This is the context for the whole epistle to the Philippians: It is Paul's Second Prison Epistle!  Paul mentions it a lot in this letter: vv 13, 14, 17, and again in [[Philippians/4/18|4:18]]

#### Phrases
- **have you in my heart** — Paul is in prison.  They sustain him in his imprisonment and partake of that suffering with him, gaining glory as he does.
- **partakers of grace** — The Philippians get the grace ... of prison??  Yes!  It is a special calling to be asked to suffer for God!
- **defense and confirmation of the gospel** — Chrysostom points out that this means they are effectively preachers.  They are co-laborers like Paul himself, and have cared for him like a wife would.  Therefore, they will partake of his blessings in the end, like a spouse being part of the same household.
