## Analysis

This is arguably the most known verse in the Bible, a popular verse for memorization.

#### Words
- **world** â€” [[Kosmos]], one of the most disputed words in the Bible, here refers to the sphere of human beings.  Elsewhere, it can mean "the unbelieving world" ([[John/7/7]]), "a whole universe" ([[John/1/10]]) or the [[Church]] ([[John/6/51]]), as within the first half of John!

## Reflections

In the section "[[Jesus and Nicodemus]]," Jesus tells Nicodemus the process that makes a person into a Christian. With John/3/16, Jesus explains that God allowed his only son to come to Earth because of his love for us. Jesus goes on to say that because of this, a person who puts their faith in God's son has eternal life.
