## Analysis

#### Words
- **wind/spirit** — The same Greek word means wind, breath, and spirit.
- **blows** — the verb form of wind/spirit.

#### Phrases
- **the wind blows** — To keep the alliteration found Greek, a useful paraphrase might be "the wind winds" or "the spirit sprints"
- **So is everyone** — We might have expected to say "so is the Spirit".  Instead, it is believers who are like the unpredictable wind.  This has been hinted at before in Scripture, in [[Zechariah/2/6]]
