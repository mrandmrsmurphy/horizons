## Analysis

#### Words
- **Rabbi** — John offered a "translation" of this word back in [[John/1/38|1:38]] and has used it five times since, four of Jesus and one of John the Baptist.
- **parent** — this is John's first use of this word ([[Help:Greek:ΓΟΝΕΥΣ|γονεύς]]/gon-eh-OOS), which occurs only in this section ([[Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind]]).
- **he was born** — (one word in Greek) The English does not show how much this word sounds like "parent".  A paraphrase might change "parent" to "those who born him".
