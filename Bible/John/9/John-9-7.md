## Analysis

#### Words
- **Siloam** — this is the LXX and Josephus spelling of שִׁלֹחַ/Shiloah.  See [[Isaiah/8/6]].
- **interpreted** — [[Help:Greek:ΕΡΜΗΝΕΥΩ|ἑρμηνεύω]]/her-may-NEW-oh seems to have special usage in John.  Aside from [[Hebrews/7/2]], he has all the uses in the NT ([[John/1/38|1:38]] and [[John/1/42|1:42]]).  In all his instances, there is a certain looseness of translation, perhaps a paraphrase or "etymologizing".  In the one case where he employs a very straight ahead translation, he uses a different word [[Help:Greek:ΜΕΘΕΡΜΗΝΕΥΩ|μεθερμηνεύω]]/meh-thir-may-NEW-oh, in [[John/1/41]].
- **Sent** — this is the verb [[Help:Greek:ΑΠΟΣΤΕΛΛΩ|ἀποστέλλω]]/apostello, where we get the English noun Apostle.  Jesus just called the Father "the one who sent me" in [[John/9/4|verse 4]].  The Greek word is different, but the connection in Hebrew/Aramaic is strong and the words are clear synonyms.

#### Phrases
- **interpreted 'Sent'** — how John arrived at this translation is a debated topic.  The Hebrew word שִׁלֹחַ/Shiloah comes from the Hebrew שָׁלַח (the root שלח) which does mean "to send".  John appears to be selectively using etymology.  The blind man is 'sent out' by Jesus.  He is sent into the mess of neighbors, Pharisees and being kick out of his community.  He is an apostle, lowercase 'a'.
