## Analysis

#### Words
- **<s>And</s>** — The first word in Greek is better symbolized in English orthography by the start of a new paragraph.
- **he** — that is, Jesus
- **passing by** — A rare word, used only here in the John and only ten times at all in the NT.
- **saw** — a special word in this story, it occurs only here and [[John/9/37|verse 37]].  It is related to the word "to know" (vv 12, 20, 21, 24, 25, 29 and 31).  It is different than the see/perceive word of [[John/9/7|verse 7]].
- **man** — not "some one" or "a certain man" or his name are phrased here, but instead the word for man, like Adam in Creation.  This man stands for the typical fallen man, for us.
- **blind** — as the second instance of this word in John (see [[John/5/3]]), we are prepared for it to be more significant this time around, and we are not disappointed.

#### Phrases
- **he saw a man blind** — Jesus "sees" the blind.  As God, he does what fallen humanity cannot.  The True Adam does what fallen Adam is unable to do.
- **from birth** — could even mean "from conception".  The other meaning of "out of birth" (i.e. because of extraction) was not lost in his own time, as the disciples reveal next.
- **blind from birth** — reminiscent of Original Sin, this man is born under a curse of ignorance, of spiritual blindness.
