## Analysis
- **As the Scripture says?  Where?** — Edmee Kingsmill (''The Song of Songs and the Eros of God: A Study in Biblical Intertextuality (Oxford Theological Monographs'')) suggests the [[Song of Songs/4/15]], where "living water" flows from the beloved, who is a garden spring.  Elsewhere in the Song, the lover praises her "belly" (LXX [[Help:Greek:ΚΟΙΛΙΑ|κοιλία]]/koilia; [[Song of Songs/7/2|7/2]]), and her belly is aroused by the lover's approach ([[Song of Songs/5/4|5/4]]). <br />This works.  The beloved is the temple, and Jesus says that the water of the Spirit will flow from the one who drinks of Him.  Each believer is an [[Ezekiel/47]] temple.  The beloved is the bride, of course, and the connection of well and bride is a staple of biblical imagery.  Living water flowing from the bride is, in part, the living water of a stream of descendants, so that betrothal near a well is a promise of the bride’s fertility.  Living water is for cleansing as well as refreshment (see [[Leviticus]] and [[Numbers]]), so those who drink from Jesus communicate not only life but purification.
