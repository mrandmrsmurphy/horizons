### Words
- **agitated** — Jesus is troubled ([[John/11/33]] - enraged at the tomb of Lazarus; [[John/12/27]] - Jesus' soul troubled at His coming crucifixion; [[John/13/21]] - Jesus' spirit troubled that one would betray Him; [[John/14/27]]); the disciples ''are'' troubled after his resurrection - [[Luke/24/38]] ; Joseph's brothers' hearts were troubled [[Genesis/42/28]]; others [[Psalm/143/4]], [[Psalm/38/10]]
- **your** — the chapter break here is a good one.  Jesus has switched from speaking to the singular-you (Peter) to the group.
- **believe** — both of these are possible imperatives or indicatives.
