## Analysis

### Words
- **Word** — ([[Logos]]) is the Greek word for "Word" and refers to [[Jesus Christ]]. John is identifying Christ as the message and meaning of God.
- **<s>the</s> God** — The lack of the [[Help:Greek:Ο|definite article]] in front of "God" in the second clause, should not be translated ''The Word was'' '''''a''''' ''God'', as the [[Jehovah's Witness]]' do.

### Phrases
- **In the beginning** — as an opening phrase is referencing [[Genesis/1/1]], the [[Creation Story]].
- **the Word was God** — John intends for his whole gospel to be read in light of this: the deeds and words of Jesus are the deeds and words of God. <ref>C.K. Barrett, ''The Gospel According to St. John: An Introduction With Commentary and Notes on the Greek Text''</ref>

### Concepts

* By referencing the [[Creation Story]], John is establishing the [[Pre-existence of Christ]].
* By saying that ''The Word was God'', John is establishing his [[Christology]].
