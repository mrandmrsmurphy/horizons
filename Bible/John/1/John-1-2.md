## Analysis

#### Words
- **He** — that is, the Word, that is, Jesus.

#### Phrases
- **in the beginning** — this forms an ''inclusio'' (wrap around) with the beginning of the [[John/1/1|previous verse]], and serves to underscore the importance of the eternality of Jesus.  He is surely high above the Created Order.
- **with God** — Like the last verse, this can best be summed up with the Christianese phrase "Godward".
