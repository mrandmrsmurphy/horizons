## Analysis

#### Words
- **the law** — it is striking that nowhere in the Pentateuch does it mention the Christ, so they must be using the term ''torah'' to refer to the entire Bible.

#### Phrases
- **Anointed remains forever** — The people are practicing good exegesis here: the Anointed, Davidic king '''''is''''' said to rule forever here: [[2 Samuel/7/13]], [[Psalm/72]], [[Psalm/89]], [[Psalm/110/4]], [[Isaiah/9/7]], [[Daniel/7]], [[Micah/4/7]]
- **who is this son of man** — the crowd is either admitting ignorance or asking for clarification about ''this'' son of man.  Perhaps they (thought) they knew the term before now, but the way Jesus describes this figure (himself) does not match their preconceived notion.
