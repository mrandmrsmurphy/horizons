## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **little one** — This is Herod the Great.  We may be shocked to hear that, because we think Herod was unimportant in world history.  However, as an Idumean (Edom, Esau), he continued the prophecies of the OT, especially [[Obadiah]].

#### Concepts
- **no face** — it's very fascinating and weird that we never see the face of the fourth beast, but only here, the face of the little horn
