## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **occasion and decree** — Herod thought that by tricking the Wise Men, he could prevent the coming of the Son of Man, an event set in time by the decree of God.
- **time, times, and half a time** — cp [[Daniel/12/7]] and [[Revelation/12/14]], which uses a very different word.  It may mean 3.5 years, but probably not.

#### Concepts
- **Parallelism** — This verse is laid out in parallel lines, a bit like a psalm.
* A. Speak against God
** B. Oppress the Saints of God
* A' Try to change God's decree
** B' They will be given into his hand for seasons
