## Analysis

#### Words
- **fourth** — The fourth world-empire is Rome.
- **diverse** — Rome was different from the previous empires, a unique beast not like the others.  Rome was first and foremost a political power, not a religious one (at least not in the way of the Babylonians, Medo-Persians, or the Greeks).  No other world-empire even pretended to be a republic!
- **iron** — Roman soldiers had armor made of strips of strong iron. The iron made the armor strong and the strips made it flexible. They also had iron helmets which protected their heads and neck.

#### Phrases
- **ten horns** — could these be the 10 priests of Rome?   Decemviri sacris faciundis
