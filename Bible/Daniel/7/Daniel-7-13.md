## Analysis

#### Words
- **like** — Why – given that Jesus identifies repeatedly with this prophecy – it is not stronger in the original, including this seemingly diminishing "like"?  It is because no distinction is made between Christ and his people.  As the chapter progresses, there is frequent, unannounced interchange between The Son of Man, and the Saints.  As we see in the NT, Jesus and the Church are '''''very''''' closely linked.

#### Phrases
- **[[Son of Man]]** — Literally, son of Adam, it is a second Adam.  This image has been developed throughout the OT, but here it is finally literal.
