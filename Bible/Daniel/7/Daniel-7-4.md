## Analysis

#### Words
- **first** — The first world empire Daniel sees is Babylon.
- **eagle** — Nebuchadnezzer's hair had grown like eagle's feathers ([[Daniel/4/33]]) in his madness.  The plucking therefore is his return to sanity and leaving behind his animal nature.

#### Phrases

#### Concepts
- **stand on two feet ... heart of a man** — Nebuchadnezzer converts to the world of the True God.  Of all the world empires, his is the most human because he leads it into a truly human role: Yahweh-worhsip.
