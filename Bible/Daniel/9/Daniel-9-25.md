## Analysis

The main chunk of this verse is a 4-part [[chiasm]]: a. build - b. 7 weeks - b' 62 weeks - a' build

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **seven weeks** — this is really 49 years, which means the next year is the year of Jubilee.  This is seen already in [[Leviticus/25/8]] (and the [[Daniel/9/24|previous verse).
- **sixty-two** — oddly enough, this number was mentioned already in Daniel, as the age of Darius in [[Daniel/5/31]]!
