## Analysis

#### Words
- **appoint** — Last said in [[Daniel/1/11]]

#### Phrases
- **Therefore** — In Aramaic, something literally "(with) all this preceding"
- **do not destroy** — Technically not an imperative, but a jussive.  So, a wooden rendering would be something like "Let you not destroy", but that is not good English!
