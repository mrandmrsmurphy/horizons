## Analysis

#### Words
- **us** — Why the shift from the first person singular throughout, to the first common plural?  Daniel identifies closely with all Israel, and if he know, now all Israel knows the coming reign of Gentile empires over the world.  The future is reassuring to God's people.

#### Phrases
- **wisdom and might** — [[Daniel/2/20]]
- **the matter of the king** — [[Daniel/2/10]]
