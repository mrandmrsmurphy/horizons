## Analysis

#### Words
- **they** — The LXX specifies only the two overseers, together with their families, as those who were cast into the lions’ den.
- **command** — “said.”
- **accused** — “had eaten the pieces of.” The Aramaic expression is ironic, in that the accusers who had figuratively “eaten the pieces of Daniel” are themselves literally devoured by the lions.

#### Phrases
- **brought and thrown** — The Aramaic active impersonal verb is often used as a substitute for the passive.
