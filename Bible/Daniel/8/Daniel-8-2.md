## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases

#### Concepts
- **Susa ... Elai** — These are places in Media, part of the Medo-Persian empire.  Either Daniel is there having a vision, or he is back in Babylon seeing himself in a scene there.  Either way, Daniel experienced Media in his life enough to know it well, presumedly on business.
- **Media** — As the vision goes on, Daniel sees God.  This means God is in Media (the Medo-Persian empire).  Why?  Because He has moved on from Babylon and is preparing to smash Babylon, which we saw back in [[Daniel/5]].
