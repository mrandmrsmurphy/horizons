## Analysis

#### Words
- **horn** — that is, Alexander

#### Phrases
- **male goat** — Perhaps we should rename Alexander the Great into Alexander the Goat!  Unfortunately, the goat is Greece, so that doesn't precisely work.

#### Concepts
- **flying ... not touching the ground** — the speed of Alexander's conquests are without precedent in the ancient world.
