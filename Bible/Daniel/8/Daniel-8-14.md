## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **abomination of desolation** â€” We tend to think this is the oppression of the people.  God is not so magically minded.  If we back track 2300 days from the 'cleansing' of the temple (Kislev 25, 165BC), we find Menelaus pilfering the temple for gold to bribe Antiochus.  (2 Maccabees 4)
