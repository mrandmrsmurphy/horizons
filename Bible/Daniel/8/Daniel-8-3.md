## Analysis

#### Words
- **ram** — The ram is the Medo-Persian empire.
- **horn** — The horns are the two aspects of the Medo-Persian empire: the Medes and the Persian.  The Persians come after the Medes, so they are the second horn.  They dominate the empire once they come, so they are also higher.
