## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **Put away ... yourselves** â€” These words appear in numerous places in the Old Testament ([[Deuteronomy/17/7]]; [[Deuteronomy/19/19|19:19]]; [[Deuteronomy/21/21|21:21]]; [[Deuteronomy/22/21|22:21]]; [[Deuteronomy/24/7|24:7]]), but the likely place being referenced is [[Deuteronomy/22]].  In that case, the offending man is being compared to a young woman who sleeps around.
