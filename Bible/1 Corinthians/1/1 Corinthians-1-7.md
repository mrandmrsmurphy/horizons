* "The function of the eschatological language in {{LV|1 Corinthians|1|7|8}}, therefore, is to short up their confidence in their identity as a unique community because of their distinctive destiny in the final judgment. ...The eschatological language of/1/7,8 is evidence that the Corinthians had accepted, at least formally, Paul's preaching of the final saving judgment of God for those who are in Christ." <ref>David W. Kuck, ''Judgment and Community Conflict: Paul's Use of Apocalyptic Judgment Language in {{LV|1 Corinthians|3|5|4|5}}'', Brill, 1992, 241</ref>
