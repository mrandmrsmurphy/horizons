## Analysis

#### Words

[[Sosthenese]] : mentioned only here and [[Acts-18-17]], he appears to be a Jewish convert to Christianity from Achaia.

#### Phrases
- **Sosthenes the brother** â€” "Paul may have had a rhetorical reason for mentioning Sosthenes: the appearance of that name in the prescript would give his argument more persuasive force and reliability in the eyes of the Corinthians." <ref>''The Corinthian Correspondence'', Reimund Bieringer, Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium - BETL 125, 421</ref>
