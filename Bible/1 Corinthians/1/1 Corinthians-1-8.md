## Analysis

#### Words
- **who** — "We understand 'God' rather than the immediately antecedent 'Jesus Christ' as the subject of the relative pronoun [[Greek:ΟΣ|ος]] for the following reasons:
# the thanksgiving section begins and ends with a reference to God (1:4,9)
# God is the implied subject of all the passive verbs in the section
# these passive include 'was confirmed' (1:6), where it is God who confirmed the testimony of Christ and this who ''also'' (note the [[Greek:ΚΑΙ|και]]) 'will confirm' (1:8) the Corinthians to the end
# that God is 'faithful' reinforces the promise that God will confirm them to the end. <ref>'The Rhetorical Role of Scripture in 1 Corinthians'', John Paul Heil, p24 footnote.</ref>

## Reflections

* "The function of the eschatological language in {{LV|1 Corinthians|1|7|8}}, therefore, is to short up their confidence in their identity as a unique community because of their distinctive destiny in the final judgment. ...The eschatological language of/1/7,8 is evidence that the Corinthians had accepted, at least formally, Paul's preaching of the final saving judgment of God for those who are in Christ." <ref>David W. Kuck, ''Judgment and Community Conflict: Paul's Use of Apocalyptic Judgment Language in {{LV|1 Corinthians|3|5|4|5}}'', Brill, 1992, 241</ref>
