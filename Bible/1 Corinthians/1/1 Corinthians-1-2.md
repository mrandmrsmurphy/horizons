## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **to the assembly of God** — before narrowing his focus in time and space, Paul address his apostolic remarks to the ''entire'' Church.
- **called to be saints** — lit. ''called to be holy'' - "believers are ''called'' to a lifestyle which reflects their ''already'' given status.  Hence the theological and ethical make contact in this phrase" <ref>Thiselton, ''Corinthians'', 77</ref>
- **call on the name of the Lord** — identical to [[Joel/2/32]] (and [[Acts/2/21]], [[Romans/10/13]])
