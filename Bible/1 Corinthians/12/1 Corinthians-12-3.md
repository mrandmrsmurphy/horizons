## Analysis

The second half of the verse is a 4-part chiasm: Spirit - Jesus - Jesus - Spirit.

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **Jesus is Lord** — The claim ‘Jesus is Lord’ is not simply a confession of his deity. It is that and more. The important eschatological point that this claim makes is that in Jesus Christ the threats to God’s promises being fulfilled have been conquered objectively and will be realized fully in the age to come. There are no powers, authorities, thrones, or dominions that can thwart his purposes, although they may present fierce opposition until they are finally destroyed. — Michael Horton ''The Christian Faith'' (Grand Rapids, Mi.: Zondervan, 2011), 527
