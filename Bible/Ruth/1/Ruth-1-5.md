## Analysis

#### Words
- **woman** — in an expected twist for an ancient Hebrew story, the protagonist turns out to be none of the men mentioned so far!
- **offspring** — this is not the normal word used (''sons''), but a word ([[Help:Hebrew:יֶלֶד|יֶלֶד]]) used only twice in Ruth (cf. [[Ruth/4/16|4/16]]).

#### Phrases
- **both died** — obviously within a narrow time frame the two men died
