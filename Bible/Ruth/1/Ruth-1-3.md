## Analysis

#### Words
- **died** â€” we are not told that Elimelech's body return to the Promised Land, like the patriarchs. That may mean we was cremated, as the Canaanites did.  In the symbolic world of the Bible, having one's body buried in the Promised Land was a symbol of being resurrected with the Saints in the eschaton (cf. Abraham and Joseph's burials).  This may mean Elimelech will be in the New Heavens and the New Earth (contrast with the ending genealogy).
