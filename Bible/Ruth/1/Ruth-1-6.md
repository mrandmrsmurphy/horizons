## Analysis

#### Words
- **then** — the demarcation of a new section begins with action.  While just a simple "and" in Hebrew, it deserves more note in English, which has a rich set of words to connect phrases.
- **Yahweh** — The star of this story (of course, of all stories) is finally mentioned by name.  Ruth famously contrasts with Esther -- the other book named after its female heroine, in the Bible -- which doesn't mention God at all.
- **bread** — in Hebrew, "bread" is the generic word for "food", just as "meat" was in older English.

#### Phrases
- **she had heard** — the good news of Israel deliverance had reached even to Moab
