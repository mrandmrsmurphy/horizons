## Analysis

#### Words
- **service** — Paul already used this word in [[Romans/9/4]].  It relates to the “liturgy” of the temple.  Paul is describing the corporate worship of the Roman church, not their individual responses.
- **reasonable** — the only other place this word is used is [[1 Peter/2/2]].  Some translations have “spiritual” which is very misleading.  Instead, it could almost be translated “logical”.  God expects us to work out changes in our liturgies in response to His actions.
