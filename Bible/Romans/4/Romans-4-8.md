## Analysis

''entire verse: [[Psalm/32/2]]''

#### Words
- **count** â€” this leitwort (keyword) of the chapter is the connecting glue to the previous quote in [[Romans/4/3|verse 3]] which quotes [[Genesis/15/6]].  Paul "uses a well-known exegetical device (known as ''gezerah sewa'') whereby a word in one text is explained by its occurrence in another text... David is talking about 'blessing,' and the whole Abrahamic narrative is about God's promise of blessing.  The reference to 'blessing' and the shared word 'reckon' suggests to Paul that the two verses are referring to the same thing.  Thus he can deduce that 'David speaks of the blessedness of those to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works ([[Romans/4/6]]).  In other words, having righteousness reckoned to oneself (Abraham) is equivalent to having one's sins forgiven (David)." <ref>''Paul and Scripture: Studying the New Testament Use of the Old Testament'', Steven Moyise, cited by Peter Leithart http://www.leithart.com/2010/08/13/pauline-semantics/ </ref>
