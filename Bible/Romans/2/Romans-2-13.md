## Analysis

#### Words
- **will be justified** â€” It is noteworthy that the first instance of the verb 'to justify' ({{GW|DIKAIOW}}/''dikaioo'') is in the future tense, referring to eschatological judgment.<ref>Don Garlington, ''A Faith that is Not Alone'', p.305</ref>.  Let we think this is some fluke, the first four references to 'righteousness' in Romans are all either paired with a future tense verb, or reference the 'day of wrath' (future).
