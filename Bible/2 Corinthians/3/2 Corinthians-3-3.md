## Analysis

#### Words
- **living** — Why does Paul include this word here? To contrast the death of the "stoney".

#### Phrases
- **spirit ... stone ... heart ... flesh** — clearly parallels [[Ezekiel/11/19]] and [[Ezekiel/36/26|36:26]]

#### Concepts

## Reflections

* This verse cannot be used to set up an antagonism between the Old and New Testaments, since it continues a dichotomy setup ''in'' the Old Testament.
