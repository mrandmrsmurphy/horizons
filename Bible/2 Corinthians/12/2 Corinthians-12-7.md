## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **thorn in the flesh** â€” the unconquered peoples of Canaan were called this ([[Numbers/33/55]], [[Judges/2/3]]) and the word "messenger" makes it highly likely this is a person or group of people.  Presumably, the unbelieving Jews who harangued Paul are in view. [http://www.bullartistry.com.au/wp/2010/02/23/thorn-in-the-flesh/]
