## Analysis

#### Words
- **God-breathed** — (Trad. "Inspired") is a word so rare and never heretofore seen that the Apostle may have coined it in this verse.  [[B. B. Warfield]] wrote a famous essay proving that it does not mean "inspired" (breathed-into), but "God-breathed"; God did not breath authority into Scripture, instead He breathed Scripture out of His mouth.

#### Phrases
- **for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction** — John Piper speculates that teaching is an umbrella term and the next three spell out how: stop a man in his error, correct the direction he is going and then show him how to conduct himself aright.
