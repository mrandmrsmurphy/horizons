## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **believed God** — although the Hebrew preposition "in" ([[Help:Hebrew:בְּ]]) is present, the uses of "believe" ([[Help:Hebrew:אָמַן|אמן]]) in the Hifil seem to refer to the act of believing that which was said, not commitment of life.<ref>[http://zondervan.typepad.com/koinonia/2008/12/nineveh.html Hebrew Corner 15: Nineveh's Response] by [[John H.
