## Analysis

This verse is identical to the corresponding part of [[1 Thessalonians/1/1]], with the addition of the word 'our'.

#### Words
- **Silvanus** — the Latin form of the Greek name ''Silas''.  They are taken to be the same man.

#### Phrases
- **Paul, Silvanus and Timothy** — Just as in [[1 Thessalonians/1/1]], Paul is listed first and is the principle author.  The other two are either simply present with him or amanuenses to help right the letter (cp. [[2 Thessalonians/2/5|2:5]] and [[2 Thessalonians/3/17]]).
