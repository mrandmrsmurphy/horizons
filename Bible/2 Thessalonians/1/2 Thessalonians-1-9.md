#### Words
- **justice** — In Greek culture, [[Justice]]/[[Help:Greek:ΔΙΚΗ|δίκη]] was a personified deity.  She was blind, held scales and a sword.  The word can also mean 'penalty', the result meted out by Justice.
- **face** — In English, no other verb goes with 'justice'.  In Greek, this rare word ([[Help:Greek:ΤΙΝΩ|τίνω]]) means 'to pay'.  It occurs nowhere else in our literature.
