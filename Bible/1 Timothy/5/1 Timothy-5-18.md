## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **You ... the grain** — [[Deuteronomy/25/4]] or [[Deuteronomy/25/15]].
- **The laborer ... wages** — [[Leviticus/19/13]] nearly matches, but [[Luke/10/7]] and [[Matthew/10/10]] are best.

#### Concepts
- **Scripture** — Paul is likely citing Gospels as Scripture, meaning they predate this epistle and were well known as such.
