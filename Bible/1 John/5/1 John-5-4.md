How complicated this verse is!  On the one hand, it is not our faith that does anything, but rather the object of our faith, the all-powerful Jesus Christ.  On the other hand, God has long ago ordained that just as his son conquered the world, so too would his church – his faithful one – conquer the world too, as his body.
