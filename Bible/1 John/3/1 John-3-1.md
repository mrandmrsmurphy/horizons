## Analysis

#### Words
- **See (trad. Behold)** â€” This reproves men's squint looking.  They do not look at God's love, but at themselves and at their own corruptions and afflictions.  It is a wonder that God's children should pore only upon their corruption, and not consider what love it is for God to discover them and pardom them.<ref>John Cotton, ''Commentary on 1 John, ad. 3:1'', cited in Sinclair Ferguson, ''Children of the Living God'', p 28</ref>
