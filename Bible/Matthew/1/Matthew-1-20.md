## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **son of David** — a title used almost exclusively of Solomon in the OT ([[1 Chronicles/29/23]]; [[2 Chronicles/1/1]]; [[2 Chronicles/13/6|13/6]]; [[2 Chronicles/30/26|30/26]]; [[2 Chronicles/35/3|35/3]]; [[Proverbs/1/1]]; [[Ecclesiastes/1/1]]), and exclusively of Jesus elsewhere in the NT.

#### Concepts

## Reflections

Joseph of Genesis, son of Jacob, was a dreamer and a sage, an interpreter of dreams.  He was a wise man.  When Joseph the "son of David" dreams, we are reminded of the dream of the original son of David at Gibeah ([[1 Kings/3]]).  There, Yahweh appeared and promised wisdom.  Joseph the "son of David" also dreams, and is told that the one who is conceived in his fiancee’s womb is Wisdom Incarnate, conceived from the Holy Spirit.
