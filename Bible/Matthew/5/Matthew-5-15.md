## Analysis

#### Words
- **<s>people</s>** — The Greek verb is in the third-person plural, which is indefinite because it has no antecedent.  This is a generic expression, so we supply the English word "people".
- **a basket** — Greek uses the definite article where English uses the indefinite article for proverbial expressions.
