## Analysis

#### Words
- **blessed** — This is the ninth and final "blessed" in the Sermon on the Mount.
- **<s>people</s>** — The sudden third-person plural is well-translated by the insertion in English of "people".
- **persecute** — This is the second verse in a row to mention this word.  It appears in the next verse too.
- **falsely** — This word is in half the manuscripts and not in half.  Either way, the outsiders are lying about the evils they accuse the Christians of.
