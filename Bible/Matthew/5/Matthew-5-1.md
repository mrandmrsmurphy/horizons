## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **he went up onto the mountain** — This exact phrase occurs here, [[Matthew/14/23]] and [[Luke/9/28]], as well as [[Exodus/19/3]], [[Exodus/24/15]], [[Exodus/24/18]], and [[Exodus/34/4]].  Clearly, a comparison is being made to Moses.
- **when he had sat down** — καθίσαντος αὐτοῦ is a [[Genitive Absolute]], so it could also be translated "After he sat down".
