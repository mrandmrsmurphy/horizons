## Reflections

Matthew says it is a fulfillment of what the prophets say, yet no prophet says it.  What could it mean?  Many commentators have suggested a link between Nazarene, describing the birthplace of Jesus, and Nazirite, describing Jesus’ dedication to His Father.  That Nazirite theme comes back in chapters 26-27, with Jesus’ vow not to drink of the fruit of the vine ([[Matthew/26/29]]) and then His refusal to receive wine and gall on the cross ([[Matthew/27/34]]).  Some have suggested passages like [[Isaiah/11/1]] might be in view.
