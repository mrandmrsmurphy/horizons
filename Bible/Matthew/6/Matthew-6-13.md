## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **<s>For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</s>** â€” the best manuscripts do not contain these words.  It is, however, very common in later centuries.  We can pray it, but it is not Scripture, though it began very early.  See Didache
