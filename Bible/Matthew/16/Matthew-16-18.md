## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **gates of the Underworld** — There are two verse in the LXX where this could have come from [[Job/38/17]] and [[Isaiah/38/10]].  The Hebrew text of Job has "gates of death" but the Greek has 'Hades'.  "The gates of hell represent the passageway from this life to the grave."<ref name="a">[[Kevin DeYoung]], [[The Gospel Coalition]], [http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/11/22/a-closer-look-at-the-gates-of-hell/ http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/11/22/a-closer-look-at-the-gates-of-hell/]</ref>

#### Concepts

## Reflections

Consequently, Jesus’ promise to Peter is not about storming Satan’s lair and conquering demonic powers. In fact, the repeated injunction in [[Ephesians/6]] is “to stand.” Christ defeated the devil ([[John/16/11]]). Our responsibility is to hold fast and resist. Carman’s fantastic music videos notwithstanding, we are not demonslayers. The promise in [[Matthew/16]] is not about venturing out on some ''Dungeons and Dragons'' spiritual crusade, but about Christ’s guarantee that the church will not be vanquished by death.
If you think about it, this makes much more sense of the imagery. Defensive gates can be used in an offensive way because Jesus is simply talking about death. Death stalks each one of us, but those who confess Jesus as the Christ know that death is not the end. We have the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ ([[1 Corinthians/15/57]]). Jesus isn’t asking us to conquer anything, except perhaps our fear of the grave.<ref name="a" />
