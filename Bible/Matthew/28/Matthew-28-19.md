## Analysis

#### Words
- **baptize** — Originally 'to dunk', or 'to immerse in water', the religious implications were known among devotees.  Many things are called 'baptisms' that do not involve immersion, so it is perhaps best translated as 'symbolic washing'.

#### Phrases
- **All the nations** — is redundant for emphasis: nations would have referred to all the non-Jewish countries and peoples automatically.

#### Concepts
- **[[Baptism]]** — is here noted as part of discipleship and true conversion.
- **[[Trinity]]** — We are baptized under the authority of the ''Triune'' God.

## Reflections

* Having just expounded His full power in the [[Matthew/28/18|previous verse]], one would have expected a potentate to tell how ''he'' would exercise it next. Instead, we see Christ sharing that power with His church, sending them to do what heretofore had been impossible.
* To whom is the command "disciple all the nations" given? As the debate within [[Matthew/28/17|verse seventeen]] indicated, there were many more present on this occasion than the Eleven. We cannot believe that the "you-all" of [[Matthew/28/20|verse twenty]] is directed only for Ministers, so this command (to "you-all") is for all believers.
