## Analysis

#### Words
- **Some** — Who does the '''some''' refer to? The [[Help:Greek:Ο|definite article]] could mean any group. However, the [[Help:Greek:ΚΑΙ|καί]] probably links the first half of the sentence with the [[Matthew 28:16|previously mentioned]] eleven ''Disciples'' and the [[Greek:ΔΕ|δέ]] sets up the heavy contrast with the other ''disciples''. This ''might'' be the occasion mentioned in [[1 Corinthians/15/6]].
- **doubted** — [[Help:Greek:ΔΙΣΤΑΖΩ|διστάζω]] does not mean settled unbelief, but '''doubt''' with the connotation of "to do a double take."
- **worship** — [[Help:Greek:ΠΡΟΣΚΥΝΕΩ|προσεκύνησαν]] refers to '''worship''' as was common in the Ancient Near East: to kiss the hand of, or to prostrate oneself and touch one's forehead to the ground.

## Reflections

* '''Worship''' is the natural response to a clear vision of the resurrected Christ. Doubt, however, is more common and pointed out in the masses. See the [[Matthew/28/18|next verse]] for Christ's response.
