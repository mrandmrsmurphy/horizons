## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **I ... am** — this is very strong in the Greek: ''ego'' (I) + with you + ''eimi'' (I am).  One could paraphrase, "I am with you, yes I am!" <ref>http://www.leithart.com/2010/04/15/immanuel/</ref>
- **with {{2pp}}** — parallels the '''''with us''''' of [[Matthew/1/23]] to form an inclusio across the entire book.

#### Concepts

* What is Christianity? What are we to teach those we convert? Matthew says here it is to '''obey'' everything, whatsoever the Lord has commanded us. This is not [[Legalism]], because it doesn't say such obedience will ''cause'' our salvation, but it certainly slams the door on [[Antinomialism]].

## Reflections

* Perhaps we are tempted to despair at the enormity of the task Jesus lays on us here. Christ jerks us out of our naval-gazing with a '''"Look!"''' . He kindly bounds the enormous task by outlining its end and comforts us by reassuring His constant presence with us.
