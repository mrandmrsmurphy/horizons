## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **Look, there was a great quake** â€” this exact phrase occurred in [[Matthew/8/24|8/24]], and was followed by demoniacs coming out of the tombs ([[Matthew/8/28|8/28]].  In the last chapter, at Jesus' crucifixion, there was an earthquake ([[Matthew/27/51|27/51]]) and saints were raised ([[Matthew/27/52|27/52]]).  The expectation, therefore, is that the same will happen here.
