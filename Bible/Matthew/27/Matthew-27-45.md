## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **sixth hour** — noon
- **ninth hour** — 3:00 P.M.
- **darkness** — Darkness is the original condition of the creation ([[Genesis/1/2]]) even so darkness falls over all the land in anticipation of a new creation.  Darkness is associated with the end of the world, when the sun, moon, and stars go out (e.g. [[Joel/2/31]]), and a world is ending with the crucifixion of Jesus. Darkness was also the final plague in Egypt prior to the Passover ({{LV|Exodus|10|21|29}}), which took place at night.  Israel has become an Egypt ([[Matthew/2/15]]), and Jesus dies in the darkness as the final Passover Lamb to deliver His people from slavery.[http://www.leithart.com/2010/03/08/sermon-notes-49/]
