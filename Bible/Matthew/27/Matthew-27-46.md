## Analysis

#### Words
- **voice** — At the creation, the voice of God rang out of the darkness with “Let there be light.”  At Golgotha, the voice of the incarnate Son cries out in anguish (cf. [[Psalm/22/1]]).  Jesus is overcoming the darkness, but He does that be entering into the darkness.  There is no rupture in the Trinity here; God doesn’t cease to be Triune for the few hours that Jesus dies on the cross.  To speak of the “death of the Son of God” is not to say that the Son of God ceased to exist.  Even normal human beings don’t cease to exist at death.  At the same time, the Son of God enters fully into the God-forsaken condition of humanity, so that He can restore communion between God and man.  God the Son entered so fully that He endured a human death, to triumph over death.[http://www.leithart.com/2010/03/08/sermon-notes-49/]
