## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **Mary the mother of James and Joses** â€” [[Matthew/13/55]] is the only other reference to these names, Jakobos and Joses, and their mother.  There, the mother Mary is clearly Jesus' mother.  We know from [[John/19/25]] that Mary the mother of Jesus was at the cross.  It is likely that the other Mary (called "the other Mary" in [[Matthew/27/61]] and [[Matthew/28/1|28/1]]) is Jesus' mother.  The woman who bore Him {{mdash}} the womb that gave Him birth and the breasts He sucked {{Mdash}} are present at His death.  Her presence gives a maternal spin to His resurrection; the tomb becomes His new womb.

Why then is she called "the mother of Jakobos and Joses" instead of the mother of Jesus?

Perhaps because Jesus is dead, and His mother is now designated by the names of her surviving sons.  Perhaps too because, though Jesus will rise from the dead, He will not rise to flesh but to Spirit.  He will no longer be identified as the Son of Mary but declared Son of God with power. http://www.leithart.com/2010/03/18/mary/
