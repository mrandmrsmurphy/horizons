## Analysis

#### Words
- **<s>and</s>** — TR begins this verse with an 'and'.
- **repent** — This imperative verb is in the plural, meaning John is addressing a group.  It is also in the present, so more like an animated GIF than a JPEG.  (It would be an over-translation to say 'keep on repenting'.)

#### Phrases
- **Kingdom of Heaven** — A Hebraism, lit. the Kingdom of the Heavens.  As throughout Matthew, this is a euphemism for the Kingdom of God.
