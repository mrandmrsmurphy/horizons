## Analysis

### Words
- **Judah** — traditionally ''Jude'' in order to sound less Jewish (or perhaps not sound like [[Judas Iscariot]])
- **Jacob** — traditionally ''James'', an obscure Romanization without basis in the Hebrew or Greek.

### Phrases
- **slave of Jesus** — a striking statement from his half-brother
- **brother of James** — the author chooses [[James the Just]] to identify with as brother.

### Concepts

* The [[Church]] is identified as those "kept in Jesus Christ", a kind of [[Perseverance of the Saints]].
