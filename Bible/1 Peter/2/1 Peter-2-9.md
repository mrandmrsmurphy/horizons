## Analysis

#### Words
- **priesthood** — or 'order of priest'.  A priest is some one who goes to God on behalf of others.  The election of Israel and Christians is so that they/we may intercede and evangelize.  Very missional.
- **that** — such an important conjunction!  The reason -- the purpose -- of God's electing love on OT Israel and on NT Christians is so that the nations might know Him.

#### Phrases
- **kingdom, priest, holy, nation** — [[Exodus/19/6]]
