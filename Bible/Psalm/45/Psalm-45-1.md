## Analysis

#### Words
- **heart** — Not merely (as in Western culture) the emotions, but the motivation or intention.
- **spumes** — a unique word, not found anywhere else.  The present tense reveals an excited state of the composer.
- **word** — Not one object, but an entire topic.
- **king** — ''for the king or to the king.''  As in many Davidic Psalms, Solomon is speaking of himself in the third person.

#### Phrases
- **good word** — or ''pleasant topic''.  We might substitute ''lovely theme''.
- **I speak** — or ''I am speaking''.  "The present tense tells of a theme almost clamoring to be heard; the poet's heart is 'astir' with it, and the words come fluently."<ref>Derek Kidner, ''Psalms'', p188</ref>
- **apt scribe** — this exact phrase is used of another Christ-figure in the Bible: [[Ezra the Prophet]] in [[Ezra/7/6]]

#### Concepts
- **First Person (I/My)** — We are given a window into the compositional process.  The write returns again at the end of the psalm, [[Psalm/45/17|verse 17]], to reflect on the bride.  See also [[Inspiration of Scripture]] and [[2 Samuel/23/2]].

## Reflections

In many, many Psalms, David is acutely aware of himself as holding an office, not merely of king but as covenant mediator.  Here, Solomon sees himself as more than he ever was.  With bursting language, he sees in his own life the Messiah who was to come, David's greater son [[Jesus Christ]].  Even before his apostasy, these words pointed to the Solomon greater than Solomon ([[Matthew/12/42]],[[Luke/11/31]]).
