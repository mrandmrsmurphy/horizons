This is a good connection to the life of Solomon, since when he began his reign he requested "wisdom to rule the nation."  Here the king is to be endowed with justice and righteousness, corollaries of Solomon's wisdom.  The way a king demonstrates justice and righteousness is by defending the cause of the "afflicted ones," [[Psalm/72/2|verse 2]] and [[Psalm/72/4|verse 4]].  The needy will be saved, but the oppressor will be destroyed.   The king is to function as the "redeemer" and defender for those people within the society who have no natural defender.[http://readingacts.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/psalm-72-the-ultimate-king/]
