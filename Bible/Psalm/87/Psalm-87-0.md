On the inclusion of this verse as part of the regular flow of the Psalm,
<blockquote>
Labuschagne says: "The Masoretic text is clearly disordered, seeing the truncated vs. 1 and the obviously displaced vs. 5c." The "truncation" he refers to is created by the decision to remove the heading in vs. 1a from the psalm. When the first half of the opening verse [4 words before atnach (the heading)] is read together with the second half of that verse [3 words after atnach], there is perfect balance—as one can observe by a glance at the distribution of the 16 'primary units'. There is no textual support whatsoever for rearranging the text of Psalm 87 in the manner Labuschagne proposes.[http://www.bibal.net/04/proso/psalms-ii/pdf/dlc_ps087-001-i.pdf]
