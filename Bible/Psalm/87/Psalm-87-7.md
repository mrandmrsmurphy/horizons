It may be worth remembering that an important part of the imagery of the Temple was "Temple-as-Garden-of-Eden." To cite just a few of the obvious links: Eden and Zion are both watered by subterranean springs via a water source known as [[Gihon]] ([[Genesis/2/6]], [[Genesis/2/13|13]]; [[1 Kings/1/33]], [[1 Kings/1/38|38]], [[1 Kings/1/45|45]]). Both are home to a tree of life (symbolized in the Temple by palms). Both once housed a snake/serpent that was there legitimately at first, but later anathematized and ejected when it proved to be a cause of sin ([[Genesis 3:24]]; {{LV|1 Kings|6|29|35}}; cf. [[Ezekiel/28/16]]). Note that in the Pentateuch, cherubim are found only in [[Genesis/3/24]], on the Ark ({{LV|Exodus|25|20|21}}) and on the Tabernacle tapestries ([[Exodus/26/1]], [[Exodus/26/31|31]]). As elsewhere in the ANE, when you see cherubim, you know you're in a temple environment. For Eden as a mountaintop locale (cf. {{LV|Ezekiel|28|11|19}}). Other ANE temples also were conceived as "gardens of the gods."
