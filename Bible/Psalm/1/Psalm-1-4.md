## Analysis

#### Words
- **wicked** — As in verse 1, the LXX has "ungodly" instead.
- **chaff** — Jesus makes the same comparison in [[Matthew/3/12]]=[[Luke/3/17]].  Chaff is the the husks of corn or other seed separated by winnowing or threshing.
- **drives away** — The LXX waxes poetical here, having "scatters away from the face of the earth".
- **wind** — As always in Scripture, there is a pun or play on words here.  The word for wind is the same as Spirit, who is the one to actually bring about the judgment at the end of time.

#### Phrases
- **not so** — This actually comes first in the Hebrew, what is called the "emphatic position".  Older translations did this in English.  The LXX repeats the phrase οὐχ οὕτως (not thusly).
