## Analysis

#### Words
- **Surely** — A marked and strong way to begin the psalm.  Calvin over-translates it as "nevertheless" or "and yet", but the point is taken.  This is a good indication that this verse is written in retrospection, unlike the rest which proceeds in order.
- **Israel** — RSV and NEB split the consonants of this word up, get "upright of God", and then omit the "of God" part.  This seems unnecessary.

#### Phrases
- **pure heart** — The same phrase was most recently mentioned in [[Psalm/24/4]]

#### Concepts
- **Israel ... those pure in heart** — Hebrew poetry is based on "rhyming ideas", not rhyming sounds as Western poetry is.  This means the two cola of verse either a) echo each other, b) contrast each other, or c) the second builds on the first.  Calvin assumes this verse is a), while c) seems more likely.  That is, Israel is most properly defined as those who are pure of heart, but such a detailed definition needs mentioning.

## Reflections

This verse actually seems to stand apart, and be the key to the entire passage.  "Heart" is the leitwort of the whole psalm.  As Buber says, "the state of the heart determines whether a man lives in the truth, in which God's goodness is experienced, or in the semblance of truth, where the fact that it 'goes ill' with him is confused with the illusion that God is not good to him." (1952)
