## Analysis

quoted in [[Acts/4/25]] and alluded to in [[Acts/14/5]].  Acts makes it clear that these verses are a prophecy of the crucifixion.

#### Words
- **why** — [[Psalm/10/1]] also starts with the word 'why', which is even translated with the same word in Greek.  [[Psalm/22/1]] begins similarly, after twice calling on God.
- **rage** — This is a hapax (unique word) in the Hebrew.  The Aramaic cognate occurs in [[Daniel/6/6]], [[Daniel/6/11|11]], and [[Daniel/6/15|15]], where is refers to "hurriedly thronging together".  The noun is used positively in [[Psalm/55/14]] and negatively in [[Psalm/64/2]].  The Greek translators of the LXX used [[Help:Greek:ΦΡΥΑΣΣΩ|φρυάσσω]] – also a hapax, which means "to neigh, to snort and stomp the ground".  ESV Footnote says, "noisily assemble".
- **nations** — Also, "Gentiles".  First found in [[Genesis/10/5]], these are the peoples of the earth, the corpuses of men, of which Israel is but on ([[Genesis/12/2]]).
- **peoples** — A poetic (perhaps later) word for 'nation' or 'people', this word was first used in [[Genesis/25/23]], but almost all its occurrences are Psalms, Isaiah, and Proverbs.
- **mediate** — Trad. "imagine".  This word just occurred in [[Psalm/1/2]].  The usage, however, is similar to the negative tone of [[Job/27/4]].
