## Analysis

#### Words
- **kiss** — [[1 Samuel/10/1]] , [[1 Kings/19/18]] , [[John/5/23]]
- **wrath** — Jesus's wrath is already mentioned in verse 5
- **take refuge** — [[Psalm/34/8]], [[Psalm/84/12]], [[Proverbs/16/20]], [[Jeremiah/17/7]], [[Psalm/146/5]], [[Isaiah/30/18]]

#### Phrases
- **kiss the son** — This actually a disputed phrase.  "Kiss" is contentious because the word is a homonym in Hebrew.  The root must be נשק, but because ש came from three sources in Proto-Semitic (#1 /ʃ/ or *š or שׁ, and  #2 /θ/ or *ṯ or שׁ , and #3 /ɬ/ or *ś or שׂ) there are three roots which might be all spelled the same.  First, there is נָשַׁק which does mean 'to kiss', cp. Aramaic ܢܫܩ , Egyptian sn, Arabic نسق , and Akkadian 𒉈𒅢 .  Second, though also spelled נָשַׁק, means "to exercise, to equip with", cp Ugaritic 𐎐𐎘𐎖 .  Third, spelled נָשַׂק, means "to burn, to kindle".  No one things #3 applies here, but ancient translations and commentators are split on "kiss" vs "exercise".
Equally contentious is "son".  In Hebrew (indeed, in verse 7), "son" is ''ben'', but here it is ''bar''.  This could be Aramaic, as indeed it is at the start of Proverbs/31.  Proponents of this translation include Ibn Ezra, Isaac Leeser, Willem A. VanGemeren.  David Kimchi allowed for both.  Some suggest, however, that we re-point the text as בֹּר, "purity".  This seems to lie underneath the LXX and Vulgate.  

The ESV is quite correct to point out that ''bar'' is Aramaic, as it is in Proverbs/31, which suggests that this Psalm is taking an aside to speak to the Nations in the more common tongue.  However, they miss the possibility that the word before it – kiss – could also be in Aramaic.  This requires not consonantal adjustment, simple repointing the vowels to read  נְשֻׁקוּ nǝšuqū.
