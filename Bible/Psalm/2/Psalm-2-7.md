## Analysis

Quoted in [[Matthew/3/17]], [[Acts/13/33]], [[Hebrews/1/5]], and [[Hebrews/5/5]]

#### Words
- **ask** — Genesis Rabbah 44:8.  R. Jonathan said: Three persons were bidden ‘ask’, viz.: Solomon, Ahaz, and the King Messiah. Solomon: Ask what I shall give thee (1 Kings III, 5). Ahaz: Ask thee a sign (Isa. VII, 11). The King Messiah: Ask of Me, etc. (Ps. II, 8).

#### Phrases
- **today ... son** — It is completely correct to say that Jesus is the uniquely begotten son of the father, eternally begotten before creation.  But that is not what this verse is saying.  It is about the coronation of Jesus, after the resurrection - [[Romans/1/4]].  That is why he is over the angels, and the great high priest.  He begins his ministry with the promise of this, if he serves (Mt/3).

#### Concepts

## Reflections

That this verse is speaking of the Messiah is not disputed.  It is agreed upon in Babylonian Talmud - Sukkah 52a and Rashi, who said "Our teachers interpreted the subject of this Psalm with reference to King Messiah, but according to its plain meaning it will be right to expound it of David himself".
