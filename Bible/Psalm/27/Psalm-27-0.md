## Analysis

#### Words
- **<s>Psalm</s>** — the Vulgate and the Authorized Version both add the word ''Psalm/Psalmus'' to the front of the verse.  The LXX and the MT both omit it.
- **by** — this single letter in Hebrew ([[Help:Hebrew:לְ|ל]]) can mean a lot of different things.  Basically, it can mean 'by' or 'for'.
- **David** — the only David mentioned in the Bible is [[King David]].

#### Phrases
- **<s>before having been anointed</s>** — the LXX and the Vulgate both contain this rare phrase.  While we may argue that they are right in sentiment (see below) we cannot accept their precise dating on textual grounds.

#### Concepts
- **by David** — At first blush, it seems most reasonable to assume that this phrase would be better translated "''for'' David", meaning ''for'' the Davidic king.  In light of [[Psalm 27:4|verse 4]] which mentions the temple, must this Psalm not have been authored after the construction of the edifice in Solomon's time? We can go a long way to solving this problem by recognizing that David began the process of temple construction by erecting the tent for the ark in Jerusalem. Though the temple was not yet built, there was a sanctuary on Zion during David’s time, and this was the foundation of the later temple.<ref>''From Silence to Song'', Leithart, p14 footnote 2</ref>
