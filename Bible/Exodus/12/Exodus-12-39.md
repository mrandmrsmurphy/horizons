## Analysis

#### Words
- **thrust** â€” Pharaoh drives Israel out of Egypt, just as Yahweh drove Adam and Eve from Eden ([[Genesis/3/24]]) and Cain from the land ([[Genesis/4/14]]). . . This verb is used twelve times in Exodus, sometimes of Israel's forced departure from Egypt but a number of times of Israel's forced expulsion of the Canaanites from the Eden land.  The people thrust out becomes the people that thrusts out.[http://www.leithart.com/2010/11/05/egyptian-eden/]
