## Analysis

#### Words
- **shone** — "cornuta" ("horned", though other meanings are possible) in the Latin Vulgate translation. The Greek Septuagint and Hebrew Masoretic texts use words meaning "radiant", suggesting an effect like a halo, though it has been argued that the Hebrew text remains unclear as to the original sense intended. Horns were symbolic of authority in ancient Near Eastern culture.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_(Michelangelo)]

Before the Flood, Man ate no meat.  Moving from vegetarianism (literally “seeds”) to meat was not only a sign of judgment, but a sign of greater judgment put into the hands of God’s Man. Noah could eat meat, and he could also sentence murderers to death. Man now had teeth in a way he had never had them before. Even we use the phrase “toothless” to refer to ineffective pieces of legislation. Teeth and tusks and ivory and horns are symbols of justice, whether they be on men, animals, or altars. A blood-covered horn means the crime is atoned for. Just as Christ was a Lamb with seven horns, worthy to open the scroll, Moses came down from Sinai with not only a “scroll” (or tablets in that case) but “''horns''.” This translation has been dismissed as errant, but perhaps the reason for it should not be dismissed so easily.
Okay, Moses’ face shone. He didn’t actually have horns despite the many depictions of him with such in various paintings and sculptures. But the primary meaning of the word from which this word “shone” is derived really is “horned.” What was Moses reflecting? The great white throne of Greater Solomon, of course, the brilliant legal glory of Yahweh. Solomon’s throne was covered in ivory.

An unrighteous Adam who faces God is gored by the horns of justice. If we don’t judge we will be judged. The blood of animals was substituted and displayed as a covering so that the High Priestly “Adam” could approach. As a righteous Adam (or a man covered by the blood), Moses received this legal glory. He became the Law-Word incarnate, the moon reflecting the sun in the nighttime of the Old Covenant, a glimpse of the glory to come in Christ.
Christ, of course, combined these two Adamic images. He was a lamb slain, but also a living lamb with seven horns. He was the ultimate satisfaction of God’s brilliant justice, then He became the minister of that justice against the unrepentant ministers of the Old Creation order. He would even call Tyre, Sidon, Sodom and Gomorrah as witnesses against the Jewish leaders when their time came.

So the word “horned” is possibly a deliberate play on words, or the use of a word that combined two meanings: shining and law. Moses was a horned altar, Sinai as a man, with a face as white and hard as enamel. Under his judgment, the righteous would be vindicated and the wicked destroyed. The threshing (chewing?) process would leave only two men alive, a number which didn’t even include Moses: Joshua and Caleb, two spies, two witnesses.
Under this new Levitical Law, a new “Garden” would be constructed, and a great many animals would be slaughtered and offered within its insatiable boundary. It was a King’s Table. Yahweh was already Omega, already Solomon. But Israel, not yet humble, desired Omega food, the food of “ascension.” Not satisfied with the bread of “priestly” obedience, they lobbied for meat to eat.[http://www.bullartistry.com.au/wp/2010/02/24/horns-of-moses/]
