* The Pharaoh now proposed genocide as the solution to the problem. This is the first, but definitely not the last time powerful rulers would seek to diminish or destroy the Israelites by a program of systematic extinction. In this case, as in Hitler's, this was regarded as the "ultimate" or "final" solution to the problem the Israelites posed.
