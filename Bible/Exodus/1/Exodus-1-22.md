## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **the river** — that is, the [[Nile]]
- **commanded all his people** — Despairing of cooperation from the midwives, Pharaoh goes public with his genocidal plan and enlists the citizenry in a search and destroy operation.
- **every son** — The boys are the threat, the girls can be raised for sexual exploitation and for domestic service in Egyptian homes.
- **cast ... in the river** — If we ask why not simply suffocate the babies or kill them in some other simple way, this may be the answer. "The Nile was one of Egypt's greatest gods. It is hardly unreasonable to read the suggestion into the decree that here was an abominable people, who would not worship the source of Egypt's life and prosperity. Let the god himself decide whether they were to live. It is not difficult to find ways and means by which one can wash one's hands and declare oneself innocent of wrongdoing and murder." <ref>Ellison, 9</ref>
