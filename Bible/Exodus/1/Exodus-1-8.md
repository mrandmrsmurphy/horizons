## Analysis

#### Words
- **king** — The specific Pharaoh is not named, which, interestingly, accords with Egyptian practice of the time. <ref>Alan Millard, "How Reliable is Exodus," ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' (July/August 2000) 55</ref> Egyptians referred to their king simply as Pharaoh.

#### Phrases
- **new king** — A new dynasty is, in all probability, what is meant. A new dynasty would not feel itself bound to the loyalties of the previous royal house.
- **did not know** — this king was not bound by any ties of loyalty to Israel for the good that Joseph had done and the enrichment of the royal house that had occurred under Joseph's administration. It does  not say that this king did not know ''about'' Joseph.  This is because he had no personal connection to him, no loyalty to him and his family.
