## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **get yourself out** — "Abram’s early history is partly that of his gradual disentanglement from country, kindred and father’s house, a process not completed until the end of chapter 13. The call had first been heard in Ur (Acts 7:2–4),1 and some interpreters censure Abram for not breaking at once with his father and nephew. But the account does not brand him a lingerer like Lot (19:16), and it is reasonable to think that he was biding God’s time until the family ties could be honourably loosened." (Kidner)

#### Concepts
- **Call** — “God’s original blessing on all humanity (1:28) now finds its fulfillment through Abraham and the nation that springs from him. In this call of Abraham and his people, the Lord reveals his freedom in being merciful to Israel, his holiness in judging them for infidelity, his faithfulness in restoring them, and his absolute sovereignty over all history.”  Bruce K. Waltke. “Genesis: A Commentary.”
