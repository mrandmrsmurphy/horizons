## Analysis

#### Words
- **Shechem** — "in the pass between mounts Ebal and Gerizim, at the crossroads of central Palestine, was marked out as a place of decision. Here the Israelites would be assembled to choose between blessing and cursing (Deut. 11:29, 30), here Joshua would give his last charge (Josh. 24), and here the kingdom of Solomon would one day break in two (1 Kgs 12) – an event leaving its trace in the Samaritan community still surviving at this spot (modern Nablus)." (Kidner)

#### Phrases
- **oak of Moreh** — The oak (not the plain, AV) of Moreh (‘Teacher’) may have gained its name from soothsaying (cf. Judg. 9:37), and the term the place may indicate the presence of a Canaanite shrine, as the final sentence hints. If so, it was a foretaste of things to come that at this stronghold of other gods the Lord revealed his presence, allocated the land to his servant and received formal homage.
