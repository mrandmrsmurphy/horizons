## Analysis

#### Words
- **South** — "The South (AV, RV) is the Negeb (RSV), the now dry area south-west of the Dead Sea, described by Nelson Glueck as ‘a key part of the immensely strategic strip of land ... binding Asia and Africa together’. Ample evidence that the Negeb was well peopled in the age of Abraham has been brought to light by Glueck, who comments on the archaeological confirmation of ‘the general validity of the historical memories of the Age of Abraham surviving in chapters 12, 13 and 14 of the Book of Genesis’.
