## Analysis

#### Words
- **Ai** — "The name Ai (always carrying the article in Hebrew) means ‘the ruin’. It seems likely that this (like Beth-el, cf. 28:19) is its acquired name (Josh. 8:28), its original Canaanite one being no longer preserved."

#### Phrases
- **called on the name of the LORD** — Abram’s "action planted the flag, so to speak, at the heart of the promised land, and declared that Yahweh’s writ runs everywhere."
- **pitched ... built** — A. "renewed the homage as he journeyed (8; cf. 13:4, 18), and there is force in the contrast between pitched and builded (8), the one for himself, the other for God. The only structures he left behind him were altars: no relics of his own wealth." (Kidner)
