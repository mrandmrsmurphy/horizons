## Analysis
- **Notice the pattern after the first two verbs** — smell/smell/bless, smell/smell/bless

#### Words
- **smelled/smell** — the words for smell are like the words for spirit/breathe.

#### Phrases
- **YHWH ... smelled the smell** — the last time these words were used was [[Genesis/8/21]]. As Yahweh "smelled the smell" of Noah's sacrifice, so Isaac "smells the smell" of the firstborn's garment on the second-born's body.  Isaac corresponds to Yahweh, Jacob to Noah (or, more strictly, to Noah's sacrifice).  Sacrifice is clothing, a covering of fragrance that covers over out natural aroma.

#### Concepts

## Reflections
- **Puns** — Sacrifice is a clothing of fragrance because it is the clothing of Spirit.
