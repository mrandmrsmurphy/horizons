## Analysis

#### Words
- **pleasant** — soothing, quieting, tranquilizing, even restful.  This is the adjective form of Noah's name.
; smell/aroma ; these words sound like the words for spirit/breathe.

#### Phrases
- **The LORD smelled the pleasant aroma.** — or ''Yahweh smelled the soothing smell'': the verb and the noun correspond, called a 'cognate accusative' in Hebrew.
- **the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth** — this is subtly different from [[Genesis/6/5]], "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the day"

#### Concepts

## Reflections
- **Puns** — "And YHWH spirited the Noahic spirit."  Sacrifices are a pleasing aroma: the Spirit of God is sacrifice.  God loves to have his righteous anger pacified. [http://www.leithart.com/2010/06/22/jacob-the-sacrifice/]
