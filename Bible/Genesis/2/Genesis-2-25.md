## Analysis

#### Words
- **naked** — This is a generally a negative word ([[Job/24]], [[Isaiah/20/4]]) but it can also just mean innocency ([[Job/1/21]]).  The king is robed in majesty ([[Psalm/93]]), but Adam and Eve were literally born yesterday and are not mature yet.
- **ashamed** — shame comes from sin, which is not yet in existence.
