## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **flesh of flesh/bone of bone** â€” John Paul II suggests that Adam's wedding song, celebrating Eve as "flesh of flesh" and "bone of bone" should not be understood merely as a statement of derivation.  Even is "flesh of flesh" not merely because she was taken from flesh; the phrases are superlatives, like "holy of holies" or "[[Song of Songs]]."  Eve is not just more human flesh; she is the perfection of flesh.<ref>http://www.leithart.com/2010/01/04/flesh-of-flesh/</ref>
