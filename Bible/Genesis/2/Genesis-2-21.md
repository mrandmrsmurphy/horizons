## Analysis

#### Words
- **deep sleep** â€” this rare word ([[Genesis/15/12]]; [[1 Samuel/26/12]]; [[Job/4/13]], [[Job/33/15|33/15]]; [[Proverbs/19/15]]; [[Isaiah/29/10]]) symbolizes a sleep like death.  Though not Fallen into Sin yet, Adam is passing from incompleteness to completeness via "death", just as we do.  Death and resurrection has always been God's economy.
