## Analysis

#### Words
- **Ur ... Terah ... Haran** — Their names suggest they worshipped the moon goddess.
- **Ur** — “This is modern Tell el-Miqayyar in Lower Mesopotamia.”  “Some think Ur refers to Urfa (Edessa) in northern Mesopotamia or some other Ur near Haran, but these interpretations contradict Acts 7:2.”Bruce K. Waltke. “Genesis: A Commentary.”
- **Caldees** — “The name “Chaldean” is probably a modernization reflecting the later editing of the book of Genesis (see “Composition and Authorship” in the introduction). The Chaldeans entered southern Mesopotamia in the first millennium B.C. and became the ruling caste there in the seventh to sixth centuries B.C.” Bruce K. Waltke. “Genesis: A Commentary.”

#### Phrases
- **Haran died** — “His premature death may have influenced Abraham’s migration from there (see 12:4–5). It explains the fate of Haran’s children in this closely knit family (see 24:3; 27:46; 31:50). Nahor marries Haran’s daughter, Milcah (11:29), who will bear him eight sons, one of whom is Bethuel, father of Laban and Rebekah. Terah and Abraham care for orphaned Lot (11:31; 12:4).” Bruce K. Waltke. “Genesis: A Commentary.”
