## Analysis

#### Words

: Haran (place) : Not to be confused with the personal name, Haran the place is located on the bank of the Balikh River, 550 miles (885 km) northwest of Ur and close to the present-day Syrian-Turkish border. Like Ur, it was an important center of moon worship.”

Excerpt From: Bruce K. Waltke. “Genesis: A Commentary.” Apple Books. 

#### Phrases
- **Terah ... went** — Wenham suggest that it was simple prudence on Terah's part to leave Ur.  For example, the Elamites destroyed the city in 1950 BC!
