## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **you will not surely die** — the Hebrew is not a flat a denial as the English appears.  A super-literal translation would be "You-all will ''not'' dying die".  The emphasis is not the non-certainty of it.  (cp. [[Psalm/49/8]] and [[Amos/9/8]] which have the same לא + infinitive absolute structure)
