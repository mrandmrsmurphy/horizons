## Analysis

- **transcendental virtues** â€” Notice the virtues Eve sees in the fruit: useful, beautiful, and wisdom-causing.  These correspond very well to the ancient virtues of goodness, beauty, and truth.  All of these things are right in and of themselves, but now they are mere justifications for doing wrong.

## Reflections

Too many commentators have suggested that Adam was tempted by Eve, after she succumbed to temptation by the Serpent.  This trivializes his role as protector and ruler, and misses the plain meaning of the text, that he was already present.  Adam watched the entire thing and did nothing.  Worse, he waited until she did not drop dead and then ate himself, using her as the first human-trial experiment.
