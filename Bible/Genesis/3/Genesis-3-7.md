## Reflections

Where their eyes ''closed'' before?  In some sense, yes.  They were in perpetual fellowship with God and therefore their eyes were not on themselves.  Nakedness means 'in need of a covering', which became true after they were abominable in the sight of God.  We all experience not noticing things because we are too transfixed on something else.  This is the end of such a state, where they were self-conscious, as only those not focused on God can be.  Notice that the first consequence of sin is a ruined relationship, their inability to look at the other or be seen by them, without feeling shame.
