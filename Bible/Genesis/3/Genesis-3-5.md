## Analysis

#### Words
- **for** — Delitzsch translates this כי as "but" saying it introduces a denial.

#### Phrases
- **you will be like God** — Satan is so deceptive!  This is true – that they do become like God – but not from some magical property of the fruit, but by the act of disobedience, knowing good from wrong.  This dollop of truth covers the lie that "they will not die", which they subsequently did.
- **good and evil** — God wanted Adam and Eve to learn the nature of benefit and loss, good and evil, by maturing through a test and discerning them from without.  Instead, they will learn them from going into evil, and thereby ceasing to be like God in that respect.

#### Concepts

## Reflections

Satan is implanting the idea that the fruit is not harmful, but that it is out of envy and ill-will that God is keeping it from them.
