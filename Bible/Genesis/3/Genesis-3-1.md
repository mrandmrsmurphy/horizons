## Analysis

See also [[2 Corinthians/11/3

#### Words
- **crafty** — this is the first hint that we are talking about something supernatural.  "Crafty" ([[Help:Hebrew:עָרוּם]]) is used primarily of people, but snakes are well-suited to their environment and move incredibly ({{LV|Proverbs|30|18|19}}), even being called "crafty" in [[Matthew/10/16]] by Jesus himself.  It is also interesting to note how much this word sounds like "naked" from the previous verse.  This seems to suggest that this test was indeed planned by God, and that they were supposed to overcome it as a cure for their naked (naive) state.
- **<s>LORD</s> God** — Satan does not address God by His covenant name YHWH.
- **woman** — The devil tactfully chooses to go after someone other than the Covenant Mediator.

#### Phrases
- **now the serpent** — all one word in the Hebrew, this construction is rare and draws special attention to the noun.  An over-translation would be "Behold! The Serpent!"
- **animal of the field** — already used in [[Genesis/2/20|2:20]] as a name for all created beasts.  Adam had reviewed all the kinds of creatures, and found that none of them were personable, that is, able to speak.  The text does not show the "behind the scenes" (that this is Satan) but the hint is clear.
- **which the Lord GOD had made** — the serpent as vessel, indeed the Devil himself, did not arise by accident nor are their origins mysterious: God made all that is.  Moreover, He did so knowing beforehand what their end would be.
- **to the woman** — The Devil is clever, attacking the woman, who is by nature not as strong as the man.  As we shall see, Adam was standing right there all along and is letting this happen.
- **indeed** — אַף כִּי is a rare Hebrew pattern, found in [[1 Samuel/23/3]], [[2 Samuel/4/11]], "an interrogative expressing surprise" (Delitzsch).  We could over translate it as "my, my!"
- **you shall not eat** — subtly different from what God actually said - God spoke in the 2nd person singular, Satan speaks in the 2nd person plural. ([[Genesis/2/16|2:16]])
- **of any tree** — in fact, God had only forbade '''''one''''' tree. ([[Genesis/2/17|2:17]])

#### Concepts
- **[[Satisfaction]]** — Satan is insinuating that God does not have their best interest at heart.  They should be satisfied with having a perfect world, being lords over it, more than enough beauty and food and meaningful work and God's word that there is a means for them to become more (The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was a test).
- **[[Covenant Mediator]]** — The Lord made Adam first, and gave the instructions regarding eating to him.  He is the one who was to bring God's instructions (Torah) to bear on future persons, serving as God's intermediary.  By letting Satan go after Eve, Adam is abdicating {{mdash}} SINNING {{mdash}} right here in verse one of the chapter/pericope.
- **The Fall of Angels** — Some commentators suppose on the basis of [[2 Peter/2]] That the fall of angels into sin (including the fall of Satan) occurs between the previous verse and this one.  While that certainly could be, it might be possible that the fall of Satan is coterminous with the Fall of Humankind in Adam, in this chapter.  The first idea has an ancient pedigree, as [[Wisdom/2]]:24 seems to allude to it.
- **Talking animals** — Why would Satan come in the guise of a snake to Adam and Eve?  It must be noted that he did not do so to Christ, the Second Adam.  In the Gospels, Jesus is tempted openly by Satan who seems to have had no false-covering.  In all in all, it seems most likely that Satan is taking advantage of Adam and Eve somehow in this disguise.  Adam was put off his guard and and does not defend his wife right away, as he ought to have done.  Unfortunately, this makes Adams's case even worse, as he ought not to have let a mere creature talk him into disobeying the Almighty Lord!

## Reflections
- **[[Satan]]** — As Jesus hints in [[John/8/44]] and Paul in [[2 Corinthians/11/14]], this serpent is a guise of Satan, a fallen angel.
