## Analysis

#### Words
- **you** — The woman continues as the serpent did, altering the quotation from YHWH to be in the second person plural.  Remember, this command was given before she was created.

#### Phrases
- **you shall not eat of it** — apart from the update in personal number, this is verbatim 2:17
- **neither shall you touch it** — not in God's statement, but perhaps wise of Eve.  'Touch' is natural extension of avoiding unclean things.  It is unclear whether Eve is being wise or accentuating the strain of God's command.
- **lest you die** — not as emphatic as YHWH's "dying die" in 2:17

#### Concepts

## Reflections

Eve's addition to the Word of God seems to indicate she is agreeing with the Devil's suggestion that the commandment is too stringent for her.  It is a small, subtle move, but perhaps the turn of her attitude towards Yahweh is beginning to show.
