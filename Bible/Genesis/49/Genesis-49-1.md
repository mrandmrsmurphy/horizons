## Analysis

#### Words
- **latter** — [[Help:Hebrew:אחרית]] is first used here.  Other example where it introduces eschatological prophecies are [[Numbers/24/14]] and [[Deuteronomy/31/29]].

#### Phrases
- **in the latter days** — undoubtedly, the brothers were thinking this meant ''their'' latter days, but as often happens, [[inaugurated Eschatology|prophetic foreshortening]] is used here to indicate an [[eschatology|eschatological]] view of the distant future.
