## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **his days will be 120 years** â€” a lot of commentators take this to mean that human being's lifespans will be quickly shortened to no more than 120 years.  Moses should be the last man to live 120 years.  But Jehoidah lives 130!  Instead, this phrase is noting how long until God destroys ''mankind'' (another translation of ADAM).
