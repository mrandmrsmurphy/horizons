## Analysis

#### Words
- **subdue** â€” "In the OT, the same word is used to describe victory in war, as when David 'subdues' his enemies.  And the word also means 'subduing' someone into slavery (see [[Jeremiah/34/11]],[[Jeremiah/34/16|16]]; [[2 Chronicles/28/10]]).  When God creates the world, it is all good, so Adam does not have to 'subdue' wicked enemies.  Still, Adam has to work hard to subdue the world.  Even before Adam sins, it is not easy to rule creation.  Animals need training, trees are tough to cut, the earth is hard to dig, and rocks are hard to break.  By working hard, Adam is to make creation a 'slave.'  He is supposed to find new ways to use what God has made, so that the whole creation serves man more and more."<ref>[[Peter Leithart]], ''A House for My Name'', p.51</ref>
