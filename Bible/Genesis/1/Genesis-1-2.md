## Analysis

#### Words
- **~~and~~** — The verbs of this verse describe a condition, not an action.  Hence, this verse cannot be taken as development ''after'' verse one, but must be an elaboration on it. (Collins, ''Science and Faith'', p88)
- **was** — cannot mean 'became'.
- **darkness** — the evil overtones of this word are intentional.  Just as this image of an incomplete Creation being made full develops, so too we see that redemption is a replacement of the darkness with light.
- **hovered** — [[Deuteronomy-32-11]] uses this rare word in the sense of a bird flying in the same position over something.
- **face** — occurs twice, as if the earth were oriented toward God and his Spirit.

#### Phrases
- **formless and void** — "rhymes" in Hebrew, mentioned again in [[Jeremiah-4-23]].  Earth is not like heaven from the beginning; it is unorganized, it is in need of content, and it is dark.

## Reflections

"And as it was with respect unto him and his work in the old creation, so it was also in the new. All things in their first production had darkness and death upon them; Neither was there anything that had either life in it, or principle of life, or any disposition thereunto. In this condition he moved on the prepared matter, preserving and cherishing of it, and communicating unto all things a principle of life, whereby they were animated, as we have declared. It was no otherwise in the new creation. There was a spiritual darkness and death came by sin on all mankind; neither was there in any man living the least principle of spiritual life, or any disposition thereunto. In this state of things, the Holy Spirit undertakes to create a new world, new heavens and a new earth, wherein righteousness should dwell. And this, in the first place, was by his effectual communication of a new principle of spiritual life unto the souls of God's elect, who were the matter designed of God for this work to be wrought upon." - John Owen, "The Holy Spirit"
