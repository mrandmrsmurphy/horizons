## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **666** — six hundred and sixty-six (χ'=600; ξ'=60; Ϛ'=6), a mystical number the meaning of which is clear when it is written in Hebrew letters נרון קסר, i.e. Νέρων Καῖσαρ, 'Nero Caesar' [Strong's]. "It’s the number of a man.  As Richard Bauckham points out (Climax of Prophecy: Studies on the Book of Revelation), 666 is also the numerical value of therion (beast), spelled in Hebrew letters.  It is the number of the beast.  Thus, Bauckham suggests, “The gematria does not merely assert that Nero is the beast: it demonstrates that he is.  Nero’s very name identifies him by its numerical value as the apocalyptic beast of Daniel’s prophecy.”" [http://www.leithart.com/2011/04/25/beastly-number/]
