## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **after these** — that is, after [[John's Vision of the Risen Christ]] and Him dictating His [[Seven Letters to the Churches]] in Asia.
- **first voice** — John recalls Jesus' voice from [[Revelation/1/10|chapter one, verse ten]], a unique sound, to say the least!

#### Concepts

## Reflections

* We are given a kind of interlude here while John begins in the way common to Apocalypic Literature: the speaker gets taken up to a heavenly scene.  This should not be taken to represent the Rapture, it is just the way these stories begin.
This verse is a mini-chiasm in itself:
* ''After these things''
** ''I looked and saw''  a door open ''in heaven''
*** and the first voice that I ''heard''
**** like a trumpet ''speaking'' with '''me''', 
*** was one ''saying'', 
** Come up ''here'' and I will ''show'' you the things which must happen 
* ''after these things''
