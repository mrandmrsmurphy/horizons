## Analysis

#### Words
- **he who** — Wallace says that “this is the first and worst grammatical solecism in Revelation” (63).  Mounce says 'The preposition ἀπό “should” be followed by an object in the genitive, and yet our three titles are all in the nominative case. Is this a mistake? No. It is generally believed that this three-fold expansion originated from Exodus 3:14 where God gives his name as, “I am who I am” (Εγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν). ὁ ὤν was expanded to include ὁ ἦν and ὁ ἐρχόμενος. As a title, it is common to have it in the nominative case, and doing so here enforces the connection with Exodus 3:14, making the reader clearly see that John’s God is the God of the burning bush.' https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/%E2%80%9Cwho-was-and-and-come%E2%80%9D-rev-1-4

#### Phrases

#### Concepts
- **"from he who is and was and comes** — Commenting on the ungrammatical nominative in the phrase, Caird says, "God is, so to speak, always in the nominative, always the subject; he always holds the initiative, and things happen because he chooses, not because men force his hand and so put him into the accusative."[http://www.leithart.com/2011/03/11/nominative-god/]
