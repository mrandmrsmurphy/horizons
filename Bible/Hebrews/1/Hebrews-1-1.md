## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **at many times and in many ways** â€” we may not understand God to be propounding a theory of developing revelation in the Old Testament, much as we should like to.  He is saying, in fact, that God set forth the truth about Himself in the O.T., in a variety of ways, sometimes telling us one aspect of the truth, sometimes another.<ref>A.B. Hanson, "The Gospel in the Old Testament", 252</ref>
