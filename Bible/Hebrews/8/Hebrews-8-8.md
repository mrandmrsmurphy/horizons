## Analysis

#### Words
- **he** — from [[Hebrews/8/6|verse 6]], it continues to be [[Jesus Christ]]
- **new** — There are two Greek words for 'new'.  [[Help:Greek:ΚΑΙΝΟΣ|καινός]] used here, means 'fresh' or 'unused'.  The Author could've used [[Help:Greek:ΝΕΟΣ|νέος]], which means 'new' simply in the sense of time.  The word choice indicates that the new covenant is not in relation to chronology, but to quality.
- **finding fault** — or ''blaming'', God says the problem with the first covenant was not in itself (contrary to most interpretations of the [[Hebrews/8/7|previous verse]]), but with the Israelites.
- **them** — the house of Israel

#### Phrases
- **Look the ... Judah** — [[Jeremiah/31/31]]
- **he said/says the LORD** — Jesus is equated plainly with the God of the Old Testament who spoke to Jeremiah.
