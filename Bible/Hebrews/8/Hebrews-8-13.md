## Analysis

#### Words
- **new** — There are two Greek words for 'new'.  [[Help:Greek:ΚΑΙΝΟΣ|καινός]] used here, means 'fresh' or 'unused'.  The Author could've used [[Greek:ΝΕΟΣ|νέος]], which means 'new' simply in the sense of time.  The word choice indicates that the new covenant is not in relation to chronology, but to quality.
- **old** — not in reference to order in time, but order in worth.  The old covenant is inferior, because it couldn't save anyone.
