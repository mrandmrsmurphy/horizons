## Analysis

#### Words
- **new** — There are two Greek words for 'new'.  [[Help:Greek:ΚΑΙΝΟΣ|καινός]] used here, means 'fresh' or 'unused'.  The Author could've used [[Help:Greek:ΝΕΟΣ|νέος]], which means 'new' simply in the sense of time.  The word choice indicates that the new covenant is not in relation to chronology, but to quality.
- **first** — this term must be used because "new" (see above) did not refer to time, but to quality.  Now the Author is being careful to distinguish chronology.
