## Analysis

#### Words
- **yesterday** — like ''day'' is so many other places, this does not refer to a 24-hour period, or even a definite area with delineated boundaries.  Given the contextual argument, this word could perhaps be paraphrased "through out Salvation History/before His incarnation".

#### Phrases
- **yesterday, today, forever** — the character of our savior, and hence our salvation, is the same in the Ancient Epoch, the Modern and Eternity.  The Incarnation didn't change God the Son from what He has always been.
