## Analysis

#### Words
- **Sabbatical** — This is a unusual word (hapax), an ''adjective''.  It seems to be modifying an absent, but assumable, "rest".  This means (per the [[Hebrews/4/8|previous verse]]), that the Israelites ''did'' enter some kind of rest when they took the land, but not the full sense which God intended for them.

#### Phrases
- **the people** — this ''always'' refers to House of Israel, the Jews, as the chosen people of God in the Old Testament. Clearly, now, it has been taken over by the Church, drawn from all nations.
