## Analysis

#### Words
- **gospel** — some try vainly to lump this usage with [[1 Thessalonians/3/6]] as one of ''two'' uses of [[Help:Greek:ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΖΩ|εὐαγγελίζω]] as a general term, not specifically THE good news.

#### Phrases
- **they to whom the gospel was before preached** — quite a remarkable description of Ancient Israel!
