## Analysis

#### Words
- **rest** — was already in existence, the reason why these men did not gain entrance was their own unbelief, not any failure on God's part to have the Rest ready.
- **although** — Long ago it had been brought into being, for what prevents it from being realized is not that any works of God require still to be done, rather God enjoys his Rest, and if His People do not, the fault lies with themselves, with man's disbelief.

#### Phrases
- **As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest** — [[Psalm/95/11]]
- **do enter into that rest** — while this is grammatically in the present tense, it is reasonable to see the futuristic elements as well.  Better still, this is [[Realized Eschatology]], "now but not yet".
