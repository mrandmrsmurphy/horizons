## Analysis

#### Words
- **Today** — related to the "day" problem, this word is difficult to nail down here, since we are reading a 2000 year old document which is quoting from a 3000 year old document.  There is not much difference if we merely substitute in the word "now". Calvin says that today "comprehends every time in which God may address us." <ref>John Calvin, Commentary on Hebrews, 88</ref>

#### Phrases
- **"Today if ... your hearts."** — [[Psalm/95/7]],[[Psalm/95/8|8]]
