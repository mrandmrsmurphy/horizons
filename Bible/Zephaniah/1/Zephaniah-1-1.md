## Analysis

#### Words
- **Hezekiah** — The Peshitta and a few masoretic MSS read “Hilkiah.” This reading has been attributed to Bar Hebraeus, identifying Hilkiah asthe father of the prophet Jeremiah. But it is maybe more likely the result of a misreading. For discussion, see Sweeney, ''Zephaniah'',48.
