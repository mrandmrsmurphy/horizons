## Analysis

A 5-point [[chiasm]] is embedded in this verse: a. “her brother” (Absalom) - b. “your brother” (Amnon) - '''c. “my sister” (Tamar)''' - b’ “your brother” (Amnon) - a’ “her brother” (Absalom). Not only are the substantives concentrically arranged, but also in their possessive suffixes, indicating the 3rd, 2nd, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person respectively.  Tamar stands in the center and is, in the first place, surrounded and enclosed by her evil brother, but he is, in turn, surrounded and enclosed by the good brother whose loving “my sister” originates in the center.
