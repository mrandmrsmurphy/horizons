## Analysis

#### Words
- **sleep** — Paul uses this word euphemistically for death, as he did in [[1 Corinthians/7/39]], [[1 Corinthians/11/30|11/30]] and [[1 Corinthians/15|chapter/15]].  Other NT authors do the same ([[2 Peter/3/4]]; [[John/11]]; [[Matthew/27/52]]; [[Acts/7/60]], [[Acts/13/36|13/36]]).
- **want** — As in [[1 Thessalonians/2/18|2/18]], Paul is expressing an emotional reality which he hope the Thessalonians will grasp.
- **grieve** — The Epicurean philosophers had a saying, "Non fui, fui, non sum, no curo"/ουκ ημην και εγενομην, ουκ ειμι και ου λυπουμαι/I was not, I was, I am not, I don't grieve"  This was, of course, whistling in the dark because we all grief and we can't help it.  Their advice was simply to fight against one's instincts in the face of overwhelming despair.

#### Phrases
- **those who are asleep** — that is, the people who believed in Christ in this life who have died.
- **we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning** — the same in [[2 Corinthians/1/18]].  [[Romans/1/13]] is the same except in the first-person singular.
