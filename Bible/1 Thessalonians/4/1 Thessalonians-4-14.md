## Analysis

#### Words
- **Jesus** — Our Lord's name does not occur without a title much outside of the Gospel Narratives account!
- **rose again** — This is not Paul's normal word for the "resurrection".

#### Phrases
- **we believe that** — it is very likely that Paul is here quoting some nascent "creed" of the first century, because the words he uses are not typical of him.
- **through Jesus** — this very odd turn of phrase is describing the ''means by which'' the dead died.  Did Jesus kill them?!  No, but they "fell asleep" -- as opposed to perishing utterly -- through the agency of our Lord.

## Reflections

“For the Christian, sleep is a particularly apt metaphor for death, since death’s finality and horror are removed by the assurance of resurrection.  Some of the Thessalonians seem to have misunderstood Paul and thought all believers would live until Christ returns.  When some died the question arose, ‘Will those who have died have part in that great day?’  Inscriptions on tombs and references in literature show that first-century pagans viewed death with horror, as the end of everything" - Barker
