## Analysis

#### Words

#### Phrases
- **word of the Lord** — the speculation is that this is Paul's rehashing of the [[Olivet Discourse]].
- **who are left** — clearly contrasts "the rest" of [[1 Thessalonians/4/14|v.14]].  Those are are outside Christ are the "leftovers" as an attribute; we who are waiting for Christ's return are ''presently'' not as privileged as the Dead in Christ will cease to be "leftovers" at His Coming.
