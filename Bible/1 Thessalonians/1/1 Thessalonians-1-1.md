## Analysis

#### Words
- **Silvanus** — This is the Latin form of the Greek name ''Silas''.
- **in** — does this modify 'assembly' or 'Thessalonians'?  While individual Thessalonians were ''in'' Christ, the church is here said to be, a concept difficult for modern individualists to grasp.  This word signifies a. close personal relationship, b. ownership by, c. instrumental cause of existence and d. type.  There were lots of assemblies in Thessalonica: this one is Christian.
- **Father** — Does this specify the relationship of Jesus to God or of the believers?  God is ''our'' Father ([[2 Thessalonians/1/1]]) and the Father of Jesus.

#### Phrases
- **Paul, Silvanus and Timothy** — Paul is listed first because he is the principle author of the work.  The others are either simply present or amanuenses (see [[1 Thessalonians/2/18|2:18]], [[1 Thessalonians/3/5|3:5]], [[1 Thessalonians/5/27|5:27]].  Also [[2 Thessalonians/1/1]] is the same).
- **trad. the church of the Thessalonians** — How are these two nouns related?  The church is composed of people who live in Thessalonica.  Not all the inhabitants are meant, but only the believers.
- **grace and peace to you** — Who is the actor in the them-ward request?  It is God, so this is a prayer.  Are not believers already at peace with God, and have they not been shown grace by Him?  They are and have been, but we are always to ask for ''more'' and petition for more for each other.
